A dose-escalation design allowed establishment of the ixazomib maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives included progression-free survival, pharmacokinetics, and tumor molecular analyses. ### results Among nine evaluable subjects, treatment was well-tolerated without dose-limiting toxicities The MTD of ixazomib was 4 mg in combination with fulvestrant. Plasma concentrations of the active form of ixazomib (MLN2238) in the 4-mg dose cohort had a median (range) Cmax of 155 (122-171) ng/mL; Tmax of 1 (1-1.5) h; terminal elimination half-life of 66.6 (57.3-102.6) hr after initial dose; AUC of 5,025 (4,160-5,345) ng*h/mL. One partial response was observed, and median progression-free survival was 51â€‰days (range 47-137). ### conclusion This drug combination has a favorable safety profile and anti-tumor activity in patients with fulvestrant-resistant advanced ER+ breast cancer that justifies future testing.",
