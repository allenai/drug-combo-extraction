The standard of care and novel treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are reviewed. ### summary Recent advances in the treatment of CLL have dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape for both patients and health care professionals. The majority of conventional first-line therapies are noncurative and are only used to treat disease that is symptomatic or progressive and include chlorambucil, monotherapy with purine analogues, and combination chemotherapy. Immunotherapeutic agents such as rituximab and alemtuzumab may be indicated in select patient populations. However, because clinical trials have found that overall survival does not depend on the initial therapy, selection of first-line therapy should be based on patient-specific factors and the patient's goals for therapy with respect to response, survival, and symptom palliation. Progression-free survival time and time to treatment are critical endpoints for CLL treatment. An increasingly important endpoint is minimal residual disease (MRD), as it is considered to be the major cause of relapse in CLL. Finally, comparison of toxicities between different therapies is critical in CLL, as it is in other disease states. Several new agents are currently being evaluated for use in CLL, including alvocidib, oblimersen, and lumiliximab. ### conclusion Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients with CLL. The introduction of rituximab , alemtuzumab , and bendamustine has improved the current outlook for patients with CLL . As overall survival does not appear to depend on the initial therapy, treatment should be selected based on patient-specific factors and goals.

Fibrosing, non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (non-IPF) interstitial lung diseases (fILDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by a different amount of inflammation and fibrosis. Therapy is currently based on corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators. However, response to these therapies is highly variable, sometimes without meaningful improvement, especially in more fibrosing forms. pirfenidone and nintedanib have recently demonstrated to reduce functional decline in patients with IPF. However, their antifibrotic mechanism makes these two drugs an interesting approach for treatment of fibrosing ILDs other than IPF. ### objectives We here report our experience with antifibrotic drugs in fibrosing non-IPF ILDs patients having a progressive phenotype during immunosuppressive therapy. ### methods Patients with a multidisciplinary team diagnosis of fibrosing non-IPF ILDs experiencing a progressive phenotype during treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators between October-2014 and January-2018 at our tertiary referral Center for ILDs were retrospectively analyzed.

The model compared tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day (BID) either as monotherapy or in combination with MTX with similarly labeled biologic therapies. Response to treatment was modeled as American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 response. ACR20 represented clinical response and determined whether patients continued therapy. ACR response rates at 6-month intervals were sourced from prescribing information and safety event rates from a published meta-analysis. Following an adverse event or a lack of response to treatment, it was assumed that 75% of patients switched to the next line of treatment (first to abatacept and then to rituximab). The perspective was that of a U.S. payer. Costs were reported in 2015 U.S. dollars and included drug wholesale acquisition costs, monitoring, drug administration, and treatment for minor and serious adverse events. The patient population eligible for treatment was based on the total number of members (i.e., RA and non-RA) in a payer organization; members with RA treated with biologic therapies were estimated using epidemiological data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of varying key parameters, including treatment-switching probability, product rebate, major rates of adverse drug reaction, and ACR20 rates, on the model outcomes. ### results tofacitinib combination therapy after MTX failure was associated with the lowest cost per member per month (PMPM) over a 2-year time frame at $5.53, compared with $6.49 for adalimumab, $6.43 for etanercept, $5.95 for certolizumab, and $5.89 for tocilizumab. Similar savings were observed when all biologics were administered as monotherapy. Tofacitinib combination therapy was also associated with the lower PMPM cost compared with adalimumab combination therapy in the TNF-IR analysis . tofacitinib was also among the lowest cost per ACR20 responder in each analysis. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that tofacitinib would potentially be cost saving even in the least optimistic scenarios. ### conclusions This analysis suggests that tofacitinib 5 mg BID following MTX failure is a lower cost per patient treatment option when used either as monotherapy or combination therapy, compared with adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab and tocilizumab biologic regimens. tofacitinib + MTX in TNF-IR patients was also predicted to be a lower-cost treatment option compared with adalimumab+MTX and was associated with the lowest cost per ACR 20/50/70 responder. ### disclosures This study was funded by Pfizer, which determined the research topic and paid York Health Economics Consortium to develop the analysis and conduct the research.

Anti-resorptive and anabolic agents are often prescribed for the treatment of osteoporosis continuously or sequentially for many years. However their impact on cortical bone quality and bone strength is not clear. ### methods Six-month old female rats were either sham operated or ovariectomized (OVX). OVX rats were left untreated for two months and then were treated with vehicle (Veh), hPTH (1-34) (PTH), alendronate (Aln), or raloxifene (Ral) sequentially for three month intervals, for a total of three periods. Mid-tibial cortical bone architecture, mass, mineralization, and strength were measured on necropsy samples obtained after each period. Bone indentation properties were measured on proximal femur necropsy samples. ### results Eight or more months of estrogen deficiency in rats resulted in decreased cortical bone area and thickness. Treatment with PTH for 3months caused the deposition of endocortical lamellar bone that increased cortical bone area, thickness, and strength. These improvements were lost when PTH was withdrawn without followup treatment, but were maintained for the maximum times tested, six months with Ral and three months with Aln. Pre-treatment with anti-resorptives was also somewhat successful in ultimately preserving the additional endocortical lamellar bone formed under PTH treatment. These treatments did not affect bone indentation properties. ### summary Sequential therapy that involved both PTH and anti-resorptive agents was required to achieve lasting improvements in cortical area, thickness, and strength in OVX rats. Anti-resorptive therapy, either prior to or following PTH, was required to preserve gains attributable to an anabolic agent.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25016965/", "doc_id": "aa7244029b3ff67b517ef6f9a89e4e34"}

The survival depends on the pathologic stage and varies from 30%-60% for stage III to 60%-80% for stage II. However, as much as 40%-50% of patients will relapse and require additional treatment of the disease. Clinical failure after resection of CRC is predominantly secondary to the clinical progression of previously undetected distant metastatic disease.

Introduction of oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting has shown a reduction of 23% in the risk of relapse when compared with 5-fluorouracil alone (MOSAIC).

Isolated rabbit hearts (Langendorff technique) were submitted to increased left ventricular stretch at the left wall by insertion of an additional intraventricular balloon and adjusting the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) to 25 mmHg for 10 min followed by 20 min recovery at normal EDP of 5-8 mmHg. Activation and repolarization processes were investigated by ventricular 256 electrode epicardial mapping. The hearts were treated during the whole procedure either with vehicle , 0.5 Î¼M flecainide ( sodium channel blocker ) or 100 Î¼M streptomycin ( here used as stretch-activated ion-channel blocker ) . In addition, we performed a series of experiments, in which we enhanced EDP to 30 mmHg (global stretch instead of local stretch) by inflating the left ventricular pressure balloon (strain, 0.148âÂ±â0.034). Each series was performed with nâ=â6. Stretch resulted in local strain of 25% at the left wall together with a local slowing of the activation process at the left wall, in a change in the activation pattern, and in ventricular arrhythmia.

Thus, in contrast to the local stretch series, there was no difference in the change in TAT between left and front wall. Only rare single ventricular extrasystoles (<1/min; originating from LV (front and left wall) i.e. from within the stretched region) were seen during stretch (but not at the beginning) and during recovery. Local left ventricular stretch can elicit ventricular arrhythmias. Local slowing of electrical activation seems involved so that the difference in total activation time of the stretched free left wall and the non-stretched increased.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24858181/", "doc_id": "90f9283bb0869bd11721e467f718e869"}

Without treatment, patients with inoperable or metastatic colorectal cancer have a median life expectancy of about 8 months. The following article is an update of our 2005 review of chemotherapy regimens used in metastatic colorectal cancer, based on the standard Prescrire methodology. In 2005, the de Gramont protocol, based on fluorouracil (always combined with folinic acid) plus either oxaliplatin (Folfox protocol) or irinotecan (Folfiri protocol), was the standard first-line chemotherapy in this setting. Four trials comparing monotherapy versus combination therapy in previously untreated patients showed that initial fluorouracil (or fluorouracil precursor) monotherapy, followed by the Folfox or Folfiri protocol in case of failure, was not associated with shorter overall survival. Two trials compared first-line treatment with the Folfiri regimen versus the Folfoxiri regimen (fluorouracil + oxaliplatin + irinotecan). One of these studies showed an increase in median survival with the Folfoxiri protocol (24 versus 17 months), but at a cost of greater neurotoxicity. The only tangible advantage of capecitabine and tegafur, two oral fluorouracil precursors, is their convenience of use. pemetrexed was less effective and more toxic than the Folfiri protocol in one trial. bevacizumab and panitumumab have yielded disappointing results in previously untreated patients. Neither of these monoclonal antibodies has yet been shown to improve overall survival. Three trials have assessed the addition of cetuximab to combinations consisting of fluorouracil or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin or irinotecan. In two of these trials, the median survival time of patients whose tumours carried the wild-type KRAS gene was about 3 months longer in the cetuximab arms, although the increase was statistically significant in only one trial. cetuximab had no impact on survival time in the third trial. In two trials , an anti-EGFR antibody ( panitumumab or cetuximab ) reduced median survival when added to bevacizumab in previously untreated patients . When progression occurs after treatment with the Folfiri protocol (or equivalent), a combination of the Folfox protocol and bevacizumab seems to increase median survival time by about 2 months versus Folfox alone, but it is also more toxic. In patients who progress after receiving the fluorouracil + oxaliplatin combination (Folfox) or the fluorouracil+ irinotecan combination (Folfiri), neither panitumumab nor cetuximab has been shown to provide a clinically meaningful increase in overall survival. It remains to be shown whether these drugs are more effective in patients with the wild-type KRAS gene than in patients with KRAS mutations. In early 2010, the standard cytotoxic drugs for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer are fluorouracil (combined with folinic acid), oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Initial combination therapy may be beneficial when the metastases are borderline operable. When the metastases are inoperable and are unlikely to become operable after chemotherapy, it seems best to begin treatment with single-agent fluorouracil (+ folinic acid) or capecitabine. The use of monoclonal antibodies in first-line treatment of patients with colorectal cancer is not justified. Further trials of these drugs are warranted as second-line treatment for patients with KRAS wild-type tumours.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21180382/", "doc_id": "842c481f52d8e56971342febee357ad0"}

The pivotal consideration is whether there are adequate benefits with combination hormonal therapy in terms of increased survival and decreased disease progression to outweigh the increased risk of adverse events and additional cost. The most recent meta-analysis by the Prostate Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group indicates a small but statistically significant survival benefit with combination hormonal therapy using nonsteroidal antiandrogens.

In addition, it is essential that treatment decisions are taken in consultation with the patient.

In an effort to overcome the cardiotoxicity observed with trastuzumab plus doxorubicin in the pivotal phase III trial, combination regimens involving potentially less toxic anthracyclines such as epirubicin and liposomal formulations of doxorubicin are ongoing. In addition, trials are investigating whether trastuzumab can reverse the resistance to hormonal therapy that develops in most women with metastatic breast cancer. These and other studies will identify the regimens that produce the best outcomes with the fewest possible side effects in women with HER2-positive breast cancer.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11694788/", "doc_id": "ab76770db4af60662537ffbe504aa0c9"}

In a repeated-measures design, men were assessed before treatment (baseline) and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. A community comparison group of men of the same age with no prostate cancer participated for the same length of time. The men were recruited from public and private urology departments from university teaching hospitals. All those with prostate cancer who were eligible for hormonal therapy had no symptoms requiring immediate therapy. In all, 82 patients were randomized and 62 completed the 1-year study, and of the 20 community participants, 15 completed the study. The main outcome measures were obtained from questionnaires on emotional distress, existential satisfaction, physical function and symptoms, social and role function, subjective cognitive function, and sexual function, combined with standard neuropsychological tests of memory, attention, and executive functions. ### results Sexual dysfunction increased for patients on androgen-suppressing therapies, and emotional distress increased in those assigned to CPA or close clinical monitoring.

Hepatitis C virus infection affects around 3% of the world population or approximately 160 million people. A variable proportion (5% to 40%) of the infected people develop clinical symptoms. Hence, hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality with hepatic fibrosis, end-stage liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma as the dominant clinical sequelae. Combination therapy with pegylated (peg) interferon-alpha and ribavirin achieves sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment) in approximately 40% to 80% of treated patients, depending on viral genotype. Recently, a new class of drugs have emerged for hepatitis C infection, the direct acting antivirals, which in combination with standard therapy or alone can lead to sustained virological response in 80% or more of treated patients. Aminoadamantanes, mostly amantadine, are antiviral drugs used for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. We have previously systematically reviewed amantadine versus placebo or no intervention and found no significant effects of the amantadine on all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and on adverse events in patients with hepatitis C. Overall, we did not observe a significant effect of amantadine on sustained virological response. In this review, we systematically review aminoadamantanes versus other antiviral drugs. ### objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of aminoadamantanes versus other antiviral drugs for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection by conducting a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials. ### Search Methods The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (1996 to December 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11 of 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to December 2013), EMBASE (1974 to December 2013), Science Citation Index EXPANDED (1900 to December 2013), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp), Google Scholar, and Eudrapharm up to December 2013. Furthermore, full text searches were conducted until December 2013. ### Selection Criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing aminoadamantanes in participants with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. ### Data Collection And Analysis Two authors independently extracted data. RevMan Analysis was used for statistical analysis of dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Methodological domains were used to assess the risk of systematic errors ('bias'). We used trial sequential analysis to assess risk of random errors ('play of chance'). ### Main Results Six randomised clinical trials with 581 participants with chronic hepatitis C were included. All trials had high risk of bias. The included trials compared amantadine versus other antiviral drugs: ribavirin, mycophenolate mofetil, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma. Standard antiviral therapy (interferon-alpha, interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, or peg interferon alpha) was administered equally to the intervention and the control groups in five trials, depending on when the trial was conducted. Four trials compared amantadine versus ribavirin. There were no deaths or liver-related morbidity in the two intervention groups (0/216 (0%) versus 0/211 (0%); 4 trials; very low quality of the evidence). The lower estimated risk for (serious) adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation with amantadine was imprecise (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.16; based on 10/216 (5%) versus 18/211 (9%) participants in 4 trials; very low quality of the evidence). There were more participants with failure of sustained virological response in the amantadine group than in the ribavirin group (206/216 (96%) versus 176/211 (84%); RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22, 4 trials; low quality of the evidence). amantadine versus ribavirin more often failed to achieve end-of follow-up biochemical response (41/46 (89%) versus 31/46 (67%); RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.63; 2 trials; very low quality of the evidence). One trial compared amantadine versus mycophenolate mofetil. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups , except that amantadine was inferior to mycophenolate mofetil regarding the outcome failure to achieve end-of treatment virological response ( low quality of evidence ) . One trial each compared amantadine versus interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma. Both comparisons showed no significant differences in the treatment outcomes (very low quality of the evidence). The observed effects could be due to real effects, systematic errors (bias), or random errors (play of chance). This possible influence on the observed effect by play of chance is due to the fact that trial sequential analyses could not confirm our findings. We were not able to perform meta-analyses on failure of histological improvement and quality of life due to lack of valid data in all trial comparisons. ### Authors Conclusions This systematic review has identified evidence of very low quality for the key outcomes of all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and adverse events in people with chronic hepatitis C when treated with amantadine compared with ribavirin, mycophenolate, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma. The timeframe for measuring the composite outcome was insufficient in the included trials. There was low quality evidence that amantadine led to more participants who failed to achieve sustained virological response compared with ribavirin. This observation may be real or caused by systematic errors (bias), but it does not seem to be caused by random error (play of chance). Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are unable to determine definitively whether amantadine is less effective than other antivirals in patients with chronic hepatitis C. As it appears less likely that future trials assessing amantadine or potentially other aminoadamantanes for patients with chronic hepatitis C would show strong benefits, it is probably better to focus on the assessments of other direct acting antiviral drugs. We found no evidence assessing other aminoadamantanes in randomised clinical trials in order to recommend or refute their use.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24937404/", "doc_id": "7bd97010e6ca716490f2fe6f366d14b6"}
