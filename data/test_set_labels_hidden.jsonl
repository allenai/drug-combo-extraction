Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been intensively investigated as a promising cancer treatment strategy. The specific mechanism of cetuximab endocytosis and its influence on cetuximab uptake, biodistribution and efficacy still remain elusive. Recently, statins have been reported to synergize with EGFR-targeting agents. Our prior work established that nystatin, a cholesterol-sequestering antifungal drug, facilitates endocytosis via the clathrin-dependent pathway. This study aimed to investigate whether nystatin regulates the uptake and efficacy of cetuximab and cetuximab-based antibody-drug conjugates (cetuximab-ADCs). In vitro and in vivo efficacies of nystatin on the uptake and activity of cetuximab/cetuximab-ADCs were studied in multiple human carcinoma cell lines and xenograft models, respectively. We identified that cholesterol sequestration by nystatin enhanced cetuximab internalization in EGFR-positive carcinoma cells by regulating EGFR trafficking/turnover and facilitating a switch from lipid rafts to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Combination treatment with cetuximab and nystatin selectively increased cetuximab uptake by tumor tissues , translating into potentiated antitumor efficacy of cetuximab in vivo ( A431 and A549 tumors ) . Nystatin-enhanced internalization of cetuximab further improved the uptake and potency of cetuximab-doxorubicin and cetuximab-methotrexate conjugates in EGFR-positive cetuximab-resistant tumors. Combination therapy with nystatin plus either cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC further prolonged animal survival and significantly suppressed tumor growth, as compared with single-agent cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC. In summary, our results identify a novel mechanism whereby cholesterol sequestration enhances the uptake of EGFR-targeting mAb and ADCs, therefore providing preclinical proof-of-concept that combination with nystatin can potentiate the delivery and efficacy of these EGFR-targeted agents.

They markedly suppress plasma estrogen levels by inhibiting or inactivating aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of estrogens from androgenic substrates [1]. Currently, the three selective aromatase inhibitors that are available are anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane which reduce circulating estrogen to 1 to 10% of pretreatment levels [2]. For advanced breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors appear to be at a minimum, equivalent and perhaps even better than tamoxifen in the first line setting [3, 4]. In primary breast cancer, adjuvant therapy with anastrozole or letrozole appears to be superior to tamoxifen in reducing the risk of relapse [5, 6].

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is overactive in many human cancers, and inhibition of STAT3 signaling is an emerging area of interest in oncology. In this study, the possibility of STAT3 inhibition as a treatment was investigated in pediatric intracranial ependymoma tissues and cell lines. STAT3 activation status was checked in ependymoma tissues. The responses to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and a STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 in primarily cultured ependymoma cells were measured by cell viability assay. Apoptosis assays were conducted to reveal the cytotoxic mechanism of applied agents. Knockdown of STAT3 was tried to confirm the effects of STAT3 inhibition in ependymoma cells. High levels of phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) expression were observed in ependymoma tissue, especially in the anaplastic histology group. There was no cytotoxic effect of cisplatin , ifosfamide , and etoposide . Both brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) and bulk tumor cells (BCs) showed considerably decreased viability after WP1066 treatment. However, BTICs had fewer responses than BCs.

Carboplatin's dose-limiting toxicity is thrombocytopenia; however, when this drug is properly dosed and combined with paclitaxel, the doublet's cycle 1 dose in chemotherapy-naive women is generally safe. Carboplatin (unlike cisplatin) contributes minimally to the cumulative sensory neuropathy of paclitaxel, thus ensuring noticeable reversibility of neuropathy symptoms following completion of 6 cycles and only occasionally requiring cessation or substitution of the taxane. Paclitaxel is responsible for the hair loss associated with the carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet; preventive measures must be considered for patients who would otherwise refuse treatment.

As part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence single technology appraisal process, brodalumab was assessed to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of its use in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics Technology Assessment Group at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article provides a summary of the Evidence Review Group's review of the company's submission, the Evidence Review Group report and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance issued in March 2018. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from three well-conducted, multicentre, double-blind randomised controlled trials. The trials demonstrated that brodalumab statistically significantly reduced the severity of psoriasis and its impact on health-related quality of life, compared with placebo, at 12 weeks. In comparison with ustekinumab, statistically significantly more patients taking brodalumab had reduced psoriasis severity at 12 weeks. Psoriasis severity and quality of life also appeared improved at 52 weeks, although statistical significance was not assessed. Withdrawal rates were comparable to drug survival rates of other biological therapies and rates of adverse events were similar between brodalumab and ustekinumab . A network meta-analysis was presented, comparing brodalumab with other therapies available at the same point in the treatment pathway (i.e. in patients for whom standard systemic therapy or phototherapy is inadequately effective, not tolerated or contraindicated). The network meta-analysis ranked treatments in order of effectiveness, in terms of achieving different levels of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index response. The results indicated that brodalumab had a similar probability of response to ixekizumab, secukinumab and infliximab and a higher probability of response than ustekinumab, adalimumab, etanercept, apremilast, dimethyl fumarate and placebo. The company's economic model compared nine treatment sequences that included three lines of active therapy, consisting of brodalumab and other comparators recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, followed by best supportive care. The sequence with brodalumab in the first-line position dominated sequences that started with adalimumab, infliximab, secukinumab and ustekinumab. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the brodalumab sequence compared to less effective and non-dominated sequences ranged from £7145 (vs. the etanercept sequence) to £13,353 (vs. the dimethyl fumarate sequence) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the more costly and effective ixekizumab sequence was £894,010 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared to the brodalumab sequence. At a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, the brodalumab sequence had the highest probability of being cost effective (96%). The main limitation of the company's economic model was the restrictive nature of the sequences compared. Twelve separate scenarios based on key uncertainties were explored by the Evidence Review Group. The only scenarios where brodalumab was ranked lower than first were not considered to be more appropriate or plausible than the assumptions or scenarios included in the company's base case. The treatment rankings identified in the Evidence Review Group's alternative base case were identical to those derived from the company's base case model. At the first National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee meeting, the Committee concluded that brodalumab appears to be as effective as other anti-interleukin-17 agents and is cost effective, based on the discount agreed in the patient access scheme. Brodalumab is recommended as an option for treating adults with severe plaque psoriasis (defined by a total Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score of 10 or more and a Dermatology Life Quality Index score of more than 10) who have not responded to other systemic non-biological therapies.

Despite improvements in detection and management, metastatic breast cancer remains a leading cause of death among women in industrialized countries. Chemotherapy is the initial treatment of choice for patients with a negative estrogen receptor status, as well as for those with a positive estrogen receptor status who have failed to respond to endocrine treatment. Patients who fail on first-line chemotherapy become candidates for second-line salvage chemotherapy; the outlook for these patients is poor, and new active agents continue to be sought. docetaxel (Taxotere; Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Antony, France) is a semisynthetic taxoid that is an inhibitor of microtubule depolymerization. This new anticancer agent has been studied in an extensive phase II clinical trial program involving 162 patients with second-line metastatic breast cancer, 134 of whom were anthracycline resistant. Doses of 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel, administered over 1 hour every 3 weeks, produced an overall response rate of 50% (range, 41% to 58%) in 129 evaluable patients, with a median duration of 6 months (range, 2 to 17 months). The response rates achieved to date with docetaxel in anthracycline-resistant patients compare favorably with those produced by the best monotherapies currently available, and are equivalent to those achieved with current combination chemotherapy options. docetaxel also was found to be highly effective in patients with a poor prognosis, having metastases in three or more organs (53%), and/or visceral sites of disease (47%).

We evaluated the effects of intravesical lidocaine on bladder urodynamics of children with myelomeningocele and tried to correlate these effects with subsequent clinical response to oral oxybutynin. ### Materials And Methods Charts of children with myelomeningocele who had undergone urodynamic examinations from 1992 to 1998 were reviewed retrospectively. In children with uninhibited contractions or poor compliance 150 to 300 mg. lidocaine were instilled for 8 minutes and cystometry was repeated. Changes in bladder capacity and compliance, number of uninhibited contractions and bladder volume at which pressure of 40 cm. H2O was reached were recorded before and after the lidocaine instillation. Clinical response to subsequent treatment with oral oxybutynin was assessed from chart review. ### results A total of 48 urodynamic studies in 22 girls and 20 boys with a mean age plus or minus standard deviation of 8.3 +/- 5.7 years and myelomeningocele were evaluable. After instillation of lidocaine, urodynamics showed increased bladder capacity in 70.8% of studies (34 of 48), with an average increase in volume of 66% (p <0.05). No change or decreased bladder capacity occurred in 29.2% of studies. Bladder compliance improved in 61.7% of the studies (29 of 47, p <0.05) and worsened in 38.3%. Bladder volume at which the pressure of 40 cm. H2O was reached increased in 77.8% of studies (14 of 18, p <0.05).

Correlation of lidocaine induced changes in bladder capacity , compliance and number of uninhibited contractions with improvement on oral oxybutynin was 70.6 % , 64.3 % and 66.7 % , respectively . ### conclusions Intravesical lidocaine can improve bladder capacity and compliance and decrease the number of uninhibited contractions in many children with neurogenic bladder caused by myelomeningocele. These observations suggest that intravesical lidocaine has effects on the neurogenic bladder that improve bladder dynamics. Although intravesical lidocaine testing may not reliably predict clinical response to oral oxybutynin at the prescribed dosages, a possible therapeutic role for intravesical lidocaine or similar agents should be explored further.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11371945/", "doc_id": "8b1bb23841ae2c6e696bac92e3c4182e"}

Using bacterial reverse mutation inhibition in vitro, with and without metabolic activation, the effect of apigenin (10-400 μg/plate) was studied on genotoxicity induced by cyclophosphamide (800 μg/plate) and by doxorubicin (0.2 μg/plate).

Micronuclei were determined microscopically in blood smears and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidative status (TAS) in whole blood, erythrocytes and plasma, respectively. Apigenin decreased doxorubicin-induced, but not cyclophosphamide-induced mutagenicity in vitro.

Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a group of uncommon and heterogeneous malignancies arising from a postthymic or mature T-lymphocyte. The treatment of PTCL remains a challenging endeavor. Compared with the more common aggressive B-cell lymphomas, more patients with PTCL will be refractory to initial therapy and those who achieve responses often will have shorter progression-free survival. Despite retrospective data that suggest that anthracycline-based multiagent chemotherapy regimens may not provide a benefit compared with nonanthracycline regimens, nonanthracycline-based regimens, with the notable exception of L-asparaginase regimens for extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, have been disappointing so far. Based on phase II evidence and subset analyses available, we believe that the addition of etoposide to standard regimens and consolidation of first remissions with autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) provides the best outcome in patients with PTCL and currently use CHOEP followed by ASCT for eligible patients with the common PTCL subtype: PTCL-NOS, AITL, and ALK negative ALCL. For those with ALK-positive ALCL standard CHOP or CHOEP is appropriate with consideration of ASCT only for those with high-risk disease. Other strategies to incorporate additional agents, such as with dose-adjusted EPOCH or sequential CHOP-ICE regimens are logical options; however, they lack the supporting literature of CHOEP. Whereas the above recommendation is our current off-protocol approach, with the possible exception of low risk ALK positive ALCL, none of these choices is supported by strong enough data to supplant a well-conceived clinical trial as the truly preferred strategy in PTCL. The novel agents , romidepsin , pralatrexate , and brentuximab vedotin , are currently approved in the relapsed/refractory setting . These agents are being studied as additions or substitutions for other agents in up-front multiagent chemotherapy regimens. In the relapsed/refractory setting, both pralatrexate and romidepsin remain well-studied choices with some patients achieving a response with durability. Clinical trials of new agents in PTCL continue to be a valuable option and an important part of routine patient management as progressive disease often is seen.

Resistance to trastuzumab is a major issue in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Several potential resistance mechanisms have been investigated, but the results are controversial and no conclusion has been reached. erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) may function in cell growth, and expressed in various cancer cells. Because the downstream signaling pathways for EPOR and HER2 partially overlapped, we hypothesized that EPOR may play a role in the inhibition effect of trastuzumab and resistance to trastuzumab. Here, we detected the expression of EPOR mRNA and protein in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines and tissues. EPOR expressed in SKBR3, MDA-MB-453, and UACC-812 cell lines, but not in BT474. Of the 55 HER2-positive cancer tissues, EPOR was positive in 42 samples and highly expressed (H-score ≥ 25) in 24 by immunohistochemistry. The difference between EPOR expression and Ki67 index was significant (P = 0.033), and EPOR expression also positively correlated with higher pathological stage (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.359; P = 0.007). Exogenous EPO antagonized trastuzumab-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in HER2/EPOR dual-positive breast cancer cells. We then exposed SKBR3 cells to trastuzumab for 4 months to obtain trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cell line, which demonstrated higher phosphorylated EPOR level, higher EPO expression and more extracellular secretion than non-resistant parental SKBR3 cells. Downregulation EPOR expression using short hairpin RNA resensitized trastuzumab-resistant cells to this drug, and SKBR3 cells with EPOR downregulation demonstrated attenuated trastuzumab resistance after the same resistance induction. EPOR downregulation plus trastuzumab produced a synergetic action in the inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-453 cell lines. Therefore, EPOR expression may be involved in tumor progression and proliferation in HER2-positive breast cancer. EPO/EPOR contributes to the mechanism of trastuzumab resistance in SKBR3 cell lines, and EPOR downregulation can reverse the resistance to trastuzumab and increase the inhibition effect of this drug.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23117856/", "doc_id": "a44da7163dbe0769202832b6392742c8"}

Visceral leishmaniosis is a widespread and potentially fatal disease of dogs and humans common in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and South America. Canine leishmaniosis is most frequently treated with the drugs meglumine antimoniate , allopurinol , amphotericin B , or a combination of meglumine antimoniate and allopurinol . Therapy with the currently used drugs often achieves temporary clinical improvement and changes in immunologic parameters with restoration of the ability to mount parasite-specific cell mediated responses and decrease in anti-leishmanial antibody titers. However, treatment usually does not prevent relapse of disease or eliminate parasite carriage. Due to the current lack of an ultimate and effective therapy for canine leishmaniosis, new drugs, delivery systems and treatment strategies are necessary to achieve a consistent parasitological cure in infected dogs.", "source": null, "doc_id": "e1316656233af591253a96acba045ca5"}
