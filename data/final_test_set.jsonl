Current treatment guidelines prefer the longer-acting agent, palonosetron, for CINV prevention in some chemotherapy regimens. A new granisetron formulation, APF530, has been developed as an alternative long-acting agent. APF530 utilizes Biochronomer(\u2122) technology to formulate a viscous tri(ethylene glycol) poly(orthoester)-based formulation that delivers - by single subcutaneous (SC) injection - therapeutic granisetron concentrations over 5 days. The poly(orthoester) polymer family contain an orthoester linkage; these bioerodible polymer systems are specifically designed for controlled, sustained drug delivery. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of APF530 250, 500, or 750 mg SC (granisetron 5, 10, or 15 mg, respectively) administered 30-60 minutes before chemotherapy were evaluated in two Phase II trials in cancer patients receiving moderately (MEC) or highly (HEC) emetogenic chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetics were dose proportional, with slow granisetron absorption and elimination. Both trials demonstrated similar results for median half-life, time to maximum concentration, and exposure for APF530 250 and 500 mg, with no differences between patients receiving MEC or HEC. A randomized Phase III trial demonstrated noninferiority of APF530 500 mg SC ( granisetron 10 mg ) to intravenous palonosetron 0.25 mg in preventing CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC in acute ( 0 - 24 hours ) and delayed ( 24 - 120 hours ) settings , with activity over 120 hours .

Therapeutic granisetron concentrations were maintained for greater than 120 hours (5 days) in both APF530 dose groups. These data suggest that APF530 - an SC-administered formulation of granisetron delivered via Biochronomer technology - represents an effective treatment option for the prevention of both acute and delayed CINV in patients receiving either MEC or HEC.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27186139/"}

Inflammation is characteristic of a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. These include Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, all of the tauopathies, multiple sclerosis and many other less common conditions. Morphologically, the level of inflammation is determined by the concentration and degree of activation of microglial cells. Biochemically, it is judged by the presence of a spectrum of inflammatory mediators. Epidemiological evidence indicates that anti-inflammatory agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a sparing effect on AD and PD indicating that inflammation exacerbates the pathology in these diseases. NSAIDs are protective in transgenic animal models of AD, providing further evidence of the negative consequences of inflammation. Here we describe an in vitro model, which was used to study the protective effects of NSAIDs in AD. This model is based on neuronal cell killing by stimulated microglia or microglia-like cells. In this model NSAIDs show protective effects at a therapeutically relevant level, which is in the low micromolar range. There are reports suggesting that NSAIDs act independently of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition, but only at higher doses. Classical NSAIDs are still the most logical choice for agents that will slow the progression or delay the onset of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases despite failures of naproxen , celecoxib and rofecoxib in AD clinical trials .

Some (but not all) observational studies show that clopidogrel users prescribed PPIs have increased risks of CV events (hazard/odds ratios=1.25-1.5). When effect sizes are small to moderate (relative risks<1.5-2.0), however, it is only possible to conclude whether statistical associations are valid in randomized trials. A randomized trial of omeprazole vs. placebo in clopidogrel users showed no difference in CV events (hazard ratio=1.02,0.70-1.51). Thus, current evidence does not justify a conclusion that PPIs are associated with CV events among clopidogrel users, let alone a judgment of causality.

Resistance is a significant limitation to the effectiveness of cancer therapies. The PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways play important roles in a variety of normal cellular processes and tumorigenesis. This study is designed to explore the relationship of these signaling pathways with multidrug resistance in prostate cancer (PCa). The PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways were investigated utilizing paclitaxel resistant DU145-TxR PCa cells and their parental non-resistant DU145 cells to determine their relationship with resistance to paclitaxel and other anticancer drugs. Our results demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways are upregulated in DU145-TxR cells compared to the DU145 cells. Inactivating these pathways using the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002 or the MAP kinase pathway inhibitor PD98059 renders the DU145-TxR cells more sensitive to paclitaxel. We investigated the effects of these inhibitors on other anticancer drugs including docetaxel , vinblastine , doxorubicin , 10-Hydroxycamptothecin ( 10-HCPT ) and cisplatin and find that both inhibitors induces DU145-TxR cells to be more sensitive only to the microtubule-targeting drugs ( paclitaxel , docetaxel and vinblastine ) . Furthermore, the treatment with these inhibitors induces cleaved-PARP production in DU145-TxR cells, suggesting that apoptosis induction might be one of the mechanisms for the reversal of drug resistance. In conclusion, the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways are associated with resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. Inactivating these pathways renders these PCa cells more sensitive to microtubule-targeting drugs such as paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinblastine.

This phase I study examined whether a heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 inhibitor tanespimycin (17-AAG; KOS-953) could be administered safely in combination with trastuzumab at a dose that inhibits Hsp90 function in vivo in lymphocytes. ### Patients And Methods Patients with an advanced solid tumor progressing during standard therapy were eligible. Patients were treated with weekly trastuzumab followed by intravenous tanespimycin, assessed in escalating dose levels. ### results Twenty-five patients were enrolled onto four tanespimycin dose levels: 225 (n = 4), 300 (n = 3), 375 (n = 8), and 450 mg/m2 (n = 10). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed at the third and fourth cohort (1 patient each): more than 2-week delay for grade 4 fatigue/grade 2 nausea and anorexia (375 mg/m2); more than 2-week delay for thrombocytopenia (450 mg/m2). Drug-related grade 3 toxicity included emesis, increased ALT, hypersensitivity reactions (two patients each), and drug-induced thrombocytopenia (n = 1). Common mild to moderate toxicities included fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, emesis, headache, rash/pruritus, increased AST/ALT, and anorexia. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated no difference in tanespimycin kinetics with or without trastuzumab. Pharmacodynamic testing showed reactive induction of Hsp70 (a marker of Hsp90 inhibition) in lymphocytes at all dose levels. Antitumor activity was noted (partial response, n = 1; minor response, n = 4; stable disease > or = 4 months, n = 4). Tumor regressions were seen only in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. ### conclusion Tanespimycin plus trastuzumab is well tolerated and has antitumor activity in patients with HER-2 + breast cancer whose tumors have progressed during treatment with trastuzumab . These data suggest that Hsp90 function can be inhibited in vivo to a degree sufficient to cause inhibition of tumor growth.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18048823/"}

Background: To determine the relevance of drug interactions with co-medication for effectiveness and tolerability of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Method: A database (MALPRO2) on travelers on their flight home from Africa to Europe between July 1988 and December 1991 was reanalyzed. It contains data on prophylaxis with mefloquine ( n = 48,264 ) , with chloroquine ( 6,752 ) , with chloroquine plus proguanil ( 19,727 ) , and with no prophylaxis ( 3,871 ) . The comparison of rates of malaria incidence and adverse events (AEs) between users and nonusers of co-medication was expressed by relative risk (RR). Results: Fifty-three percent of travelers (63% of females, 43% of males) used co-medication in all prophylaxis groups, with an average of 1.35 additional drugs per person and about two AEs reported per person. With the exception of antidiarrheals plus mefloquine, malaria incidence with co-medication was lower (RR = 0.8) than without co-medication. In all regimens, the proportion of travelers reporting AEs was about 1.5-fold with co-medication (p<.01); that reporting severe AEs was twice as high as compared to with no co-medication. mefloquine AE rates for various classes of co-medication were similar to that of chloroquine, with highest AE and severity rates with neuropsychiatric drugs (excluding antiepileptics, RR = 1.9 and 2.9), and lowest rates with cardiovasculars (RR = 1.1 and 1.0). Various co-medications were used with different frequencies in males and females, and the latter reported more AEs. Conclusion: These data suggest that co-medications commonly used by travelers have no significant clinical impact on safety and effectiveness of prophylaxis with mefloquine or chloroquine. Increased frequency and severity of AEs when using co-medication rather is explained by underlying illness.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9815496/"}

We hypothesized that the brain damage mitigating effect of mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest can be enhanced with thiopental loading , and even more so with the further addition of phenytoin and methylprednisolone . Twenty-four dogs (four groups of six dogs each) received VF 12.5 min no-flow, reversed with brief cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), controlled ventilation to 20 h, and intensive care to 96 h. Group 1 with normothermia throughout and randomized group 2 with mild hypothermia (from reperfusion to 2 h) were controls. Then, group 3 received in addition, thiopental 90 mg/kg i.v. over the first 6 h. Then, group 4 received, in addition to group 2 treatment, thiopental 30 mg/kg i.v. over the first 90 min (because the larger dose had produced cardiopulmonary complications), plus phenytoin 15 mg/kg i.v. at 15 min after reperfusion, and methylprednisolone 130 mg/kg i.v. over 20 h. All dogs survived. Best overall performance categories (OPC) achieved (OPC 1 = normal, OPC 5 = brain death) were better in group 2 than group 1 (< 0.05) and numerically better in groups 3 or 4 than in groups 1 or 2. Good cerebral outcome (OPC 1 or 2) was achieved by all six dogs only in group 4 (P < 0.05 group 4 vs. 2). Best NDS were 44 +/- 3% in group 1; 20 +/- 14% in group 2 (P = 0.002); 21 +/- 15% in group 3 (NS vs. group 2); and 7 +/- 8% in group 4 (P = 0.08 vs. group 2).

Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable tumor due to the high rate of relapse that still occurs. Acquired drug resistance represents the most challenging obstacle to the extension of survival and several studies have been conducted to understand the mechanisms of this phenomenon. Mitochondrial pathways have been extensively investigated, demonstrating that cancer cells become resistant to drugs by reprogramming their metabolic assessment. MM cells acquire resistance to proteasome inhibitors (PIs), activating protection programs, such as a reduction in oxidative stress, down-regulating pro-apoptotic, and up-regulating anti-apoptotic signals. Knowledge of the mechanisms through which tumor cells escape control of the immune system and acquire resistance to drugs has led to the creation of new compounds that can restore the response by leading to cell death. In this scenario, based on all literature data available, our review represents the first collection of anti-mitochondrial compounds able to overcome drug resistance in MM.

We evaluated clinical outcomes including prostate-specific antigen decline of >30% (PSA30) or >50% (PSA50), PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and clinical/radiographic PFS. We performed multivariable modeling to control for baseline and on-treatment differences between groups. ### results Compared to subjects who received enzalutamide post-abiraterone, subjects who received docetaxel post-abiraterone had more bone metastases, more visceral metastases, higher baseline PSA, and had more frequent PSA tests while on-treatment. There were no significant differences in PSA30 (41% for enzalutamide vs. 53% for docetaxel) or PSA50 (34% vs. 40%) response rates between the two groups; there remained no difference after stratifying by presence/absence of prior response to abiraterone.

Systemic vasculitis is classified as primary (eg, polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome) or secondary, the latter associated with connective tissue disorders, infections, medications, and rarely, as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Neuropathy is a common complication of systemic vasculitis and is related to ischemic nerve fiber damage with axon loss. Peripheral neuropathy may be the sole manifestation of vasculitis, a condition termed nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN). Treatment of vasculitic neuropathy requires long-term immunosuppressive therapies with potential side effects. The diagnosis of vasculitis should be established by tissue (preferably nerve) biopsy. High-dose prednisone is the standard platform therapy for patients with systemic and NSVN; for those with systemic vasculitis, at least 3 to 12 months of treatment with cyclophosphamide (monthly intravenous pulse or daily oral therapy) is also necessary to sustain remission and allow successful prednisone tapering. The use of cyclophosphamide in patients with NSVN is controversial , but recent retrospective data suggest that those treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide from the outset fare better than those initially treated only with prednisone . If prednisone is administered as monotherapy, cyclophosphamide should be added after several months if there is no improvement or relapse occurs with tapering of prednisone.

One resistance mechanism for cediranib is up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This study aimed to determine if dual therapy with cediranib and the oral EGFR inhibitor gefitinib improved outcome in recurrent glioblastoma. ### Methods And Findings This was a multi-center randomized , two-armed , double-blinded phase II study comparing cediranib plus gefitinib versus cediranib plus placebo in subjects with first relapse/first progression of glioblastoma following surgery and chemoradiotherapy . The primary outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and radiologic response rate. Recruitment was terminated early following suspension of the cediranib program. 38 subjects (112 planned) were enrolled with 19 subjects in each treatment arm. Median PFS with cediranib plus gefitinib was 3.6 months compared to 2.8 months for cediranib plus placebo (HR; 0.72, 90% CI; 0.41 to 1.26).

Consecutive eyes with persistent diabetic macular edema following at least three previous intravitreal bevacizumab injections prior to intravitreal ranibizumab, at least three-monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections and at least 12\u2009months of follow-up were included.

The methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin (MVAC) regimen has been the standard treatment in patients with locally advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer for the past 15 years. The minimal or moderate survival benefit-depending on prognostic features-and the severe toxicity associated with the MVAC regimen have made the search for new drugs and drug combinations of utmost importance to increase efficacy and/or decrease toxicity. In this respect, the taxanes and gemcitabine are promising new drugs. Paclitaxel and docetaxel as single agents have yielded overall response rates of 7 % to 56 % , depending on whether the patients have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease . The combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin has been explored in three studies with a total of 104 evaluable patients, a pooled overall response (OR) rate of 61%, and a complete response (CR) rate of 20%. There are two studies of docetaxel and cisplatin with a total of 91 evaluable patients, an OR rate of 54%, and a CR rate of 16%. The OR rate for paclitaxel and carboplatin in six studies was 43%, with a CR rate of 13%; however, the reported median survival was only 8.5 to 9.5 months. The OR rate for single-agent gemcitabine based on five studies was 26%, with a CR rate of 9%, which was apparently independent of whether the patients had received prior chemotherapy. The OR rate for gemcitabine and cisplatin in four phase II studies ranged from 41% to 57%, with a CR rate of 15% to 22% and a median survival of 12.5 to 14.3 months.

This study of 405 randomized patients showed that the two regimens were associated with similar response rates, time to progression, and overall survival, whereas GC was associated with less toxicity than MVAC. On the basis of this superior risk-benefit ratio, the GC regimen should be favored as a new standard treatment in patients with locally advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer. Other promising combinations include gemcitabine and paclitaxel, with or without cisplatin, and the combination of ifosfamide, paclitaxel, and cisplatin. The triple combination of gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and cisplatin has yielded an OR rate of 78%, a CR rate of 28%, and a median survival of 24 months.

Late antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) triggered by donor-specific antibodies (DSA) is a cardinal cause of kidney allograft dysfunction and loss.

Recent randomized controlled trials ( RCT ) have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of widely used therapies , such as rituximab plus intravenous immunoglobulin or proteasome inhibition ( bortezomib ) , reinforcing a great need for new therapeutic concepts . One promising target in this context may be interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine known to play an important role in inflammation and adaptive immunity. ### methods This investigator-driven RCT was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of clazakizumab, a genetically engineered humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6. The study will include 20 DSA-positive kidney allograft recipients diagnosed with ABMR \u2265\u2009365\u2009days after transplantation. Participants will be recruited at two study sites in Austria and Germany (Medical University of Vienna; Charit\u00e9 University Medicine Berlin). First, patients will enter a three-month double-blind RCT (1,1 randomization, stratification according to ABMR phenotype and study site) and will receive either clazakizumab (subcutaneous administration of 25\u2009mg in monthly intervals) or placebo. In a second open-label part of the trial (months 4-12), all patients will receive clazakizumab at 25\u2009mg every month. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints are the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clazakizumab, its effect on drug metabolism in the liver, DSA characteristics, morphological ABMR lesions and molecular gene expression patterns in three- and 12-month protocol biopsies, serum/urinary biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial activation/injury, Torque Teno viral load as a measure of overall immunosuppression, kidney function, urinary protein excretion, as well as transplant and patient survival. ### discussion Currently, there is no treatment proven to be effective in halting the progression of late ABMR. Based on the hypothesis that antagonizing the effects of IL-6 improves the outcome of DSA-positive late ABMR by counteracting DSA-triggered inflammation and B cell/plasma cell-driven alloimmunity, we suggest that our trial has the potential to provide proof of concept of a novel treatment of this type of rejection. ### Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03444103 .

Syngenic animals showed no inflammation or histological alterations (CADI: 1.7+/-2.0). ### conclusions In conclusion, in the DA-->BN combination with triple drug treatment, early mild inflammation was followed by the development of chronic rejection and can be used as an experimental model that resembles the clinical situation in renal transplantation.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9448142/"}

Objective Some previous studies have found clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and cilostazol for prevention of secondary stroke, but the physiological mechanism involved remains unknown. We aimed to clarify the effects of aspirin/cilostazol therapy on the platelet and endothelial functions of patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, in comparison to patients who were treated with aspirin alone. Methods The present randomized prospective pilot study enrolled 24 patients within a week after the onset of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (100 mg/day) (A group; 11 patients) or cilostazol (200 mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day) (CA group; 13 patients). We measured platelet aggregation, platelet activation, and the thrombomodulin (TM), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and von Willebrand (vWF) antigen levels and vWF activity over a 4-week period after enrollment. Results There was no significant difference in the platelet functions of the A and CA groups. However, the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was decreased at 2 and 4 weeks (p<0.05) after treatment in comparison to the pre-treatment values in the CA group, but not in the A group. Platelet activation, and the hs-CRP, TM, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and vWF values did not significantly decrease after treatment in either group. Conclusion Although there were no significant differences in platelet aggregation, platelet activation or the endothelial biomarker levels of the A and CA groups, dual therapy with aspirin and cilostazol inhibited platelet aggregation in comparison to the pre-treatment values, similarly to patients who received aspirin alone.

Each treatment period lasted 7 weeks. ezetimibe and ezetimibe/simvastatin decreased fractional cholesterol absorption by 65% and 59%, respectively (P < 0.001 for both relative to placebo). simvastatin did not significantly affect cholesterol absorption. ezetimibe and ezetimibe/simvastatin increased fecal sterol excretion (corrected for dietary cholesterol), which also represents net steady state cholesterol synthesis, by 109% and 79%, respectively (P < 0.001). ezetimibe, simvastatin, and ezetimibe/simvastatin decreased plasma LDL-cholesterol by 20, 38, and 55%, respectively. The coadministered therapy was well tolerated. The decreases in net cholesterol synthesis and increased fecal sterol excretion yielded nearly additive reductions in LDL-cholesterol for the coadministration of ezetimibe and simvastatin.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19380898/"}

This study examines whether the regulations impacted methamphetamine arrests. ### design ARIMA-intervention time-series analysis with control series. ### setting California (1982-2001). ### measurements Dependent variable series: monthly methamphetamine arrests. Control series: monthly marijuana arrests and cocaine/heroin arrests. ### interventions Bulk powder ephedrine and pseudoephedrine: regulated November 1989. Products containing ephedrine as the single active medicinal ingredient: regulated August 1995. pseudoephedrine products: regulated October 1997. Large-scale producers used ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in these forms. Ephedrine combined with other active medicinal ingredients (e.g. various cold medicines)-used mainly by small-scale producers: regulated October 1996. ### findings The regulation targeting small-scale producers (1996) had no significant impact. In contrast, methamphetamine arrests stopped rising and dropped 31% to 45% each of the three times precursor chemicals used by large-scale producers were regulated. Within 3 years of the bulk powder regulation (1989) and again within 2 years of the ephedrine single ingredient regulation (1995), arrests fully rebounded. During the 4 years following the last regulation (pseudoephedrine products, 1997) arrests only partially rebounded. These effects parallel those reported on hospital admissions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS RNA was extracted from 1,372 tumor blocks from postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer in the monotherapy arms of ATAC. Twenty-one genes were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and the RS was calculated. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the value of adding RS to a model with clinical variables (age, tumor size, grade, and treatment) in node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N+) women. RESULTS Reportable scores were available from 1,231 evaluable patients (N0, n = 872; N+, n = 306; and node status unknown, n = 53); 72, 74, and six DRs occurred in N0, N+, and node status unknown patients, respectively. For both N0 and N+ patients, RS was significantly associated with time to DR in multivariate analyses (P < .001 for N0 and P = .002 for N+). RS also showed significant prognostic value beyond that provided by Adjuvant! Online (P < .001).

Given the availability of a number of alternative biologic treatment options and other novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinicians are faced with an increasingly challenging choice regarding optimal treatment. Biologics are usually combined with traditional DMARDs, primarily methotrexate (MTX), but some biologics and tofacitinib (together referred to in this article as novel DMARDs) have been shown to be efficacious as monotherapy as well. In real-world practice, approximately one-third of RA patients receiving biologics are on monotherapy, primarily because of intolerance of, or noncompliance with, MTX. Limited data, however, are available analyzing the effectiveness of monotherapy compared with combination therapy across novel DMARDs. ### objective To compare American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses to approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) at 24 weeks in RA patients who have shown inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (DMARD-IR). ### methods Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified randomized controlled trials that assessed approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with MTX in DMARD-IR RA patients. Twenty-eight RCTs were identified that evaluated abatacept, anakinra, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib. ACR responses at 24 weeks were extracted and combined by means of Bayesian network meta-analyses. ### results With the exception of anakinra plus MTX, which was less efficacious, most novel DMARDs, when used in combination with MTX, demonstrated comparable ACR responses. When novel DMARDs were used as monotherapies , greater ACR20/50/70 responses were observed with tocilizumab than with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents ( aTNF ) or tofacitinib . Furthermore, ACR20/50/70 responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab monotherapy (odds ratio [OR] for the indirect comparison\u2009=\u20091.08, 95% credible interval [CrI]\u2009=\u20090.40-2.84; OR\u2009=\u20091.24, CrI\u2009=\u20090.44-3.61; OR\u2009=\u20090.95, CrI\u2009=\u20090.33-2.72, respectively), whereas greater responses were observed with aTNF plus MTX than with aTNF monotherapy (OR\u2009=\u20092.41, CrI\u2009=\u20090.51-11.61; OR\u2009=\u20092.85, CrI\u2009=\u20090.51-17.67; OR\u2009=\u20091.28, CrI\u2009=\u20090.21-8.42, respectively). Relative efficacy estimates for the indirect comparison of tofacitinib plus MTX with tofacitinib monotherapy were very uncertain. ### conclusions Results suggest that in combination with MTX most of the available novel DMARDs have similar levels of efficacy in DMARD-IR patients. As monotherapy, however, tocilizumab displayed higher ACR responses than aTNF or tofacitinib. ACR responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab as monotherapy, whereas aTNF in combination with MTX demonstrated greater ACR responses than aTNF as monotherapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25943002/"}

On separate days, each animal underwent the experimental protocol with one of three agents: ephedrine, phenylephrine, and normal saline-control. The experimental protocol was as follows : ( 1 ) at time zero , intravenous infusion of ritodrine was begun ; ( 2 ) at 120 min , 2 % lidocaine was given epidurally to achieve a sensory level of at least T6 ; and ( 3 ) at 135 min , an intravenous bolus of either ephedrine , phenylephrine , or normal saline-control was given , followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of the same agent for 30 min . In the ephedrine and phenylephrine experiments, the rate of infusion was adjusted to maintain maternal mean arterial pressure close to baseline. ### results ritodrine infusion alone significantly increased maternal heart rate and cardiac output in all three groups. Epidural anesthesia during ritodrine infusion significantly decreased maternal mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, uterine blood flow, and fetal arterial oxygen tension for each of the three groups. Both ephedrine and phenylephrine restored maternal mean arterial pressure to baseline, as designed. Ephedrine significantly increased uterine blood flow and fetal arterial oxygen tension when compared with normal saline--control, but phenylephrine did not. phenylephrine significantly increased uterine vascular resistance when compared with normal saline--control, but ephedrine did not. ### conclusions Although ephedrine and phenylephrine provided similar restoration of maternal mean arterial pressure, ephedrine was superior to phenylephrine in restoring uterine blood flow during ritodrine infusion and epidural anesthesia-induced hypotension in gravid ewes. Also, ephedrine, but not phenylephrine, significantly improved fetal oxygenation, when compared to normal saline--control.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8017645/"}

The thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine (TBF) protocol has recently demonstrated promising outcome in cord blood and haploidentical SCT; however, there is limited evidence about this regimen in transplant from matched siblings (MSD) and unrelated donors (UD). We retrospectively compared outcomes of 2523 patients aged 18-50 with AML in remission, undergoing transplant from MSD or UD prepared with either TBF or BuCy conditioning. A 1:3 pair-matched analysis was performed: 146 patients receiving TBF were compared with 438 patients receiving BuCy. Relapse risk was significantly lower in the TBF when compared with BuCy group (HR 0.6, P\u2009=\u2009.02), while NRM did not differ. No significant difference was observed in LFS and OS between the two regimens. TBF was associated with a trend towards higher risk of grades III-IV aGVHD (HR 1.8, P\u2009=\u2009.06) and inferior cGVHD (HR 0.7, P\u2009=\u2009.04) when compared with BuCy. In patients undergoing transplant in first remission, the advantage for TBF in terms of relapse was more evident (HR 0.4, P\u2009=\u2009.02), leading to a trend for better LFS in favor of TBF (HR 0.7, P\u2009=\u2009.10), while OS did not differ between the two cohorts.

These two regimens consisted either of fractionated total body irradiation and etoposide (FTBI/VP-16) or high-dose busulfan with cyclophosphamide (BU/CY). Only patients who had failed prior conventional management at least once were study eligible, ie, no patients with acute leukemia in first remission (CR) or in first chronic phase (CP) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) participated. Patients were stratified according to the following risk criteria: \"good-risk\" patients were those who were in second CR of their acute leukemia or in accelerated phase (AP) of CML; \"poor-risk\" patients had further advanced stages of leukemia. During a 52-month period, 131 patients were registered of whom 122 (93%) were study eligible. Sixty-one eligible patients were randomized to the FTBI/VP-16 arm and 61 to the BU/CY regimen. Of these 122 patients, 114 (93%) proceeded to BMT according to protocol. Posttransplant immunosuppression to prevent graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) consisted of cyclosporine and prednisone ( CSA/PSE ) . Neither overall survival nor disease-free survival (DFS) differed significantly between the two treatment groups (P = .89 and .69, respectively). Estimated DFS for \"good-risk\" patients who had been prepared with the FTBI/VP-16 regimen was 55% +/- 11%, as compared with patients treated with BU/CY whose DFS figure was 34% +/- 10% (P = .30). For \"poor-risk\" candidates, the DFS rates at 24 months were 17% +/- 6% (for FTBI/VP-16) and 24% +/- 8% (for BU/CY), respectively (P = .81).

This study also confirmed the efficacy of the CSA/PSE combination in the prevention of GVHD with 23 of 113 (20%) of BMT recipients developing moderate to severe acute GVHD. The leading cause for treatment failure was leukemic relapse (45 of the 114 BMT recipients suffered a recurrence of their leukemia), whereas 38 patients died without evidence of relapse.

We examined the reactivity of factor IXa with several isolated Kunitz-type inhibitor domains: basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2, and the first two inhibitor domains of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. We find that enhancement of factor IXa reactivity by enoxaparin is greatest for basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (>10-fold), followed by the second tissue factor pathway inhibitor domain (1.7-fold) and the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2 (1.4-fold). Modeling studies of factor IXa with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor suggest that binding of this inhibitor is sterically hindered by the 99-loop of factor IXa, specifically residue Lys(98). Slow-binding kinetic studies support the formation of a weak initial enzyme-inhibitor complex between factor IXa and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor that is facilitated by enoxaparin binding. Mutation of Lys(98) to Ala in factor IXa results in enhanced reactivity with all inhibitors examined, whereas almost completely abrogating the enhancing effects of enoxaparin.

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors modulate signaling pathways involved in cell cycle progression, and recent phase II trials demonstrate activity in patients with endometrial cancer. Our objective was to examine the effects of combination therapy with rapamycin and paclitaxel in endometrial cancer cell lines. paclitaxel inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines with IC(50) values of 0.1-0.5 nM and 1-5 nM for Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells, respectively. To assess synergy of paclitaxel and rapamycin, the combination index (CI) was calculated by the method of Chou and Talalay. Simultaneous exposure of cells to various doses of paclitaxel in combination with rapamycin (1 nM) resulted in a significant synergistic anti-proliferative effect (CI <1, range 0.131-0.920). rapamycin alone did not induce apoptosis, but combined treatment with paclitaxel increased apoptosis over that of paclitaxel alone. Treatment with rapamycin and paclitaxel resulted in decreased phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 , two critical downstream targets of the mTOR pathway . rapamycin decreased hTERT mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR while paclitaxel alone had no effect on telomerase activity. paclitaxel increased polymerization and acetylation of tubulin, and rapamycin appeared to enhance this effect. Thus, in conclusion, we demonstrate that rapamycin potentiates the effects of paclitaxel in endometrial cancer cells through inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and potentially increased polymerization and acetylation of tubulin.

The aim of this project was to identify novel relevant markers of CML LSCs. ### Experimental Design CML LSCs were examined by flow cytometry, qPCR, and various bioassays. In addition, we examined the multipotent CD25(+)CML cell line KU812. ### results In contrast to normal hematopoietic stem cells, CD34(+)/CD38(-)CML LSCs expressed the IL-2 receptor alpha chain, IL-2RA (CD25).

The ultrasound probe was activated at low (4.1 +/- 0.9 mm Hg), mid (10.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), and high (17.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP). Effects of ultrasound were less pronounced at higher EDP. For example, the time interval from end-diastole to peak (-)dP/dt decreased by 7.5 +/- 2.3% at low, 4.4 +/- 2.2% at mid, and 1.9 +/- 1.6% at high LVEDP (p < 0.001). In protocol B (n = 7), LV inotropic state was altered by slow intravenous infusion of low-dose calcium. The ultrasound probe was activated before and after calcium. Effects of ultrasound were less pronounced after calcium. Time from end-diastole to peak (-)dP/dt decreased by 8.4 +/- 3.1% at baseline and by 3.5 +/- 2.1% after calcium (p < 0.001). In protocol C (n = 7), activation of the ultrasound probe was performed at baseline and after mild selective alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation (propranolol plus phenylephrine). Effects of ultrasound were similar at baseline and after propranolol but increased after phenylephrine . Time from end-diastole to peak (-)dP/dt decreased by 5.2 +/- 2.4% at baseline, by 5.3 +/- 1.9% after propranolol, and by 8.9 +/- 3.2% after phenylephrine (p < 0.05). ### conclusions Effects of intracavitary ultrasound, which are presumably mediated through modulation of endocardial endothelial function, were more important at low volume, lower calcium, and under mild selective alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7681734/"}

To determine an OBD (based on a gene re-expression end point), 14 patients received decitabine alone for 10 days. To determine the MTD, 11 patients received decitabine (at OBD, days 1 through 10) plus dose-escalating VA (days 5 through 21). ### results The OBD of decitabine was 20 mg/m(2)/d intravenously, with limited nonhematologic toxicity. In patients treated with decitabine plus VA, dose-limiting encephalopathy occurred in two of two patients at VA 25 mg/kg/d and one of six patients at VA 20 mg/kg/d. Drug-induced re-expression of estrogen receptor (ER) was associated with clinical response (P < or = .05). ER promoter demethylation, global DNA hypomethylation, depletion of DNA methyltransferase enzyme, and histone hyperacetylation were also observed. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the response rate was 44% (11 of 25).

Classes of MDS-associated mutations and disordered biological pathways targeted by developmental therapeutics include the following: aberrant messenger RNA splicing, neomorphic enzymes in the citric acid cycle with oncogenic activity, overactivated tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases, epigenetic and chromatin remodeling alterations, abnormal telomere dynamics, and failed protection of DNA integrity. At present, treatments for MDS are usually administered as sequential monotherapy, but there is a trend toward clinical trials of combination therapies-in which new agents are added to a DNA hypomethylating agent backbone-for both upfront treatment and the treatment of relapsed/refractory disease. Agents in clinical trials for subsets of MDS include luspatercept , antibodies targeting CD33 , isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors , deacetylase inhibitors , venetoclax , and immunotherapies designed to overcome immune checkpoint inhibition .

Melanoma has two key features, an over-representation of UV-induced mutations and resistance to DNA damaging chemotherapy agents. Both of these features may result from dysfunction of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, in particular the DNA damage detection branch, global genome repair (GGR). The key GGR component XPC does not respond to DNA damage in melanoma, the cause of this lack of response has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the role of methylation in reduced XPC in melanoma. ### methods To reduce methylation and induce DNA-damage, melanoma cell lines were treated with decitabine and carboplatin, individually and sequentially. Global DNA methylation levels, XPC mRNA and protein expression and methylation of the XPC promoter were examined. Apoptosis, cell proliferation and senescence were also quantified. XPC siRNA was used to determine that the responses seen were reliant on XPC induction. ### results Treatment with high-dose decitabine resulted in global demethylation, including the the shores of the XPC CpG island and significantly increased XPC mRNA expression. Lower, clinically relevant dose of decitabine also resulted in global demethylation including the CpG island shores and induced XPC in 50% of cell lines. decitabine followed by DNA-damaging carboplatin treatment led to significantly higher XPC expression in 75% of melanoma cell lines tested. Combined sequential treatment also resulted in a greater apoptotic response in 75% of cell lines compared to carboplatin alone, and significantly slowed cell proliferation, with some melanoma cell lines going into senescence. Inhibiting the increased XPC using siRNA had a small but significant negative effect, indicating that XPC plays a partial role in the response to sequential decitabine and carboplatin. ### conclusions Demethylation using decitabine increased XPC and apoptosis after sequential carboplatin.

There is an increasing use and variety of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (beta-blockers) available for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Recent comparative studies suggest that atenolol ( 200 mg daily ) , metoprolol ( 200 mg daily ) ; acebutolol ( 400 mg daily ) , oxprenolol ( 160 mg daily ) , nadolol ( 80 mg daily ) and timolol ( 20 mg daily ) produce a beneficial clinical response equal to that seen with propranolol ( 160 mg daily ) . Most beta-blockers reduce resting heart rate by approximately 25 to 30 beats/min, although a lesser reduction is seen with those possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as oxprenolol and pindolol. While earlier studies employing large doses of intravenous propranolol concluded that beta-blockade reduced myocardial contractility, more recent non-invasive studies suggest that the predominant cardiac effect is on heart rate. In patients with cardiac failure, beta-blockers may, however, produce a profound fall in cardiac output. Nevertheless, in combination with digoxin they may be useful in controlling the atrial fibrillation of thyrocardiac disease. beta-Blockers improve nervousness and tremor (although to a lesser extent with cardioselective agents) and severe myopathy, and they also reduce the frequency of paralysis in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. There is often subjective improvement in sweating but usually no major effect on eye signs. Recent studies show a 10% reduction in oxygen consumption/basal metabolic rate with long term oral use of selective or nonselective beta-blockers. In addition, many agents (propranolol, metoprolol, nadolol and sotalol but not acebutolol, atenolol or oxprenolol) reduce circulating tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentration by between 10 and 40%, although the clinical significance of this effect (if any) is not established. beta-Blockers may also have endocrinological effects on gastrin, cyclic AMP, catecholamines and other hormone levels. Given in adequate dosage, propranolol has been shown to control thyrotoxic hypercalcaemia. Minor side effects (nausea, headaches, tiredness, etc.) are quite common but overall beta-blockers are well tolerated by the thyrotoxic patient. The major use of these drugs is in symptomatic control while awaiting definitive diagnosis or treatment. As an adjunct to antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine, beta-blockers will produce a satisfactory clinical response in the weeks to months before these forms of therapy produce a euthyroid state. beta-Blockers are more convenient than antithyroid drugs in the control of patients receiving therapeutic radioiodine, in that continuous therapy and assessment of biochemical response is possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6144501/"}

Pharmacokinetics and antitumour activity studies were performed on normal Kunming mice and female BALB/c nude mice with MDR HL-60 xenografts, respectively. ### results topotecan alone was effective in inhibiting the growth of non-resistant leukaemia cells, K562 and HL-60 cells but not the growth of MDR HL-60 cells. The resistance of topotecan in MDR HL-60 cells was potently reversed by the addition of amlodipine . Moreover, amlodipine enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect of topotecan synergistically. Apoptosis was through activating caspases in a cascade: first, the initiator caspase 8 and then effectors caspase 3/7 (total activity of caspases 3 and 7) were activated. Being encapsulated into the stealthy liposomes with an acidic internal medium, topotecan existed dominantly in an active lactone species, which was reversibly changed from an inactive carboxylate form via a pH-dependent reaction. After administration of stealthy liposomes to mice, the blood exposure of the lactone form was evidently increased and extended. The antitumour effects in the MDR HL-60 xenografted tumour were stealthy liposomal topotecan (SLT) plus amlodipine > SLT > un-encapsulated topotecan > blank control. ### conclusions The enhanced antitumour activity in the MDR HL-60 cells by the SLT plus amlodipine could be owing to multiple reasons: (a) synergistic apoptosis inducing effect, (b) reversing MDR by amlodipine and (c) increasing the availability of active lactone of topotecan by the stealthy liposomes. The apoptosis induced by amlodipine is through caspase 8 and then the 3/7 signalling pathway.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16684125/"}

However, clinical use of the terfenadine has been associated with rare but severe cardiac arrhythmias, in particular torsades de pointes. ### objective To establish a quantitative experimental model for assessing the sedating and cardiotoxicity potential of non-sedating and sedating antihistamines. ### methods Drugs were administered intravenously and the integrated amplitude of the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) signal was recorded. The threshold dose that depressed EEG activity was compared with the dose required to inhibit by 50% the peripheral bronchospasm elicited by 10 micrograms/kg i.v., of histamine.

We were unable to evaluate the EEG effects of terfenadine, because it produced cardiovascular collapse at 10 mg/kg, i.v. loratadine and promethazine did not produce adverse cardiovascular effects, nor did they alter normal ECG activity. diphenhydramine produced bradycardia followed by a transient hypertensive phase without affecting the QTc interval. In contrast, terfenadine elicited hypotension, bradycardia and significant arrhythmogenic activity, causing a prolongation of the QTc interval and a torsades de pointes--like ventricular arrhythmia. Pharmacokinetic studies after i.v. administration of loratadine (30 and 100 mg/kg) demonstrated plasma levels of loratadine and its major metabolite descarboethoxyloratadine to be several orders of magnitude greater than levels found in humans at the clinical dose of 10 mg. ### conclusion The CNS depressant effects of H1 antihistamines are promethazine approximately diphenhydramine >> loratadine = placebo. Of the non-sedating antihistamines, loratadine was devoid of adverse cardiovascular effects whereas terfenadine caused a pronounced disruption of the normal ECG, characterized by a torsades de pointes-like effect.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8556569/"}

Regimen 1 was pemetrexed (200-600 mg/m(2)); regimen 2 was pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) with escalating carboplatin doses (AUC = 4-6). Both regimens included concurrent radiation (40-66 Gy; palliative-intent doses were lower). ### results Thirty patients (18 locally advanced and 12 metastatic with dominant local symptoms) were enrolled, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0/1/2 (n = 8/21/1). All dose levels were tolerable for regimen 1 (n = 18: 15 NSCLC and 3 esophageal cancers) and regimen 2 (n = 12: all NSCLC). In regimen 1, one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 4 esophagitis/anorexia) occurred (500 mg/m(2)). Grade 3 neutropenia (3 of 18 patients) was the main hematologic toxicity.

Exercise prescriptions will be tailored to each participant's fitness and morbidities. The primary endpoint is OS. Secondary endpoints include time to disease progression, occurrence of a skeletal-related event or progression of pain, and degree of pain, opiate use, physical and emotional quality of life, and changes in metabolic biomarkers. An assessment of whether immune function, inflammation, dysregulation of insulin and energy metabolism, and androgen biomarkers are associated with OS will be performed, and whether they mediate the primary association between exercise and OS will also be investigated.

First line chemotherapeutics for brain tumors (malignant gliomas) are alkylating agents such as temozolomide and nimustine. Despite growing knowledge of how these agents work, patients suffering from this malignancy still face a dismal prognosis. Alkylating agents target DNA, forming the killing lesion O(6)-alkylguanine, which is converted into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that trigger apoptosis. Here we assessed whether inhibiting repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a reasonable strategy for sensitizing glioma cells to alkylating agents. For down-regulation of HR in glioma cells, we used an interference RNA (iRNA) approach targeting Rad51 and BRCA2, and for NHEJ we employed the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026. We also assessed whether inhibition of poly(ADP)ribosyltransferase (PARP) by olaparib would enhance the killing effect. The data show that knockdown of Rad51 or BRCA2 greatly sensitizes cells to DSBs and the induction of cell death following temozolomide and nimustine ( ACNU ) . It did not sensitize to ionizing radiation (IR). The expression of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) abolished all these effects, indicating that O(6)-alkylguanine induced by these drugs is the primary lesion responsible for the formation of DSBs and increased sensitivity of glioma cells following knockdown of Rad51 and BRCA2. Inhibition of DNA-PK only slightly sensitized to temozolomide whereas a significant effect was observed with IR. A triple strategy including siRNA and the PARP inhibitor olaparib further improved the killing effect of temozolomide.

We have analyzed the second malignancies in patients treated in the German Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. ### Materials And Methods From January 1981 through June 1991, 674 patients were registered in the two sequential multicentric Ewing's sarcoma trials CESS 81 (recruitment period 1981-1985) and CESS 86 (1986-1991). The systemic treatment in both studies consisted of a four-drug-regimen ( VACA = vincristine , actinomycin D , cyclophosphamide , and adriamycin ; or VAIA = vincristine , actinomycin D , ifosfamide , and adriamycin ) and a total number of four courses , each lasting nine weeks , was recommended by the protocol . Local therapy in curative patients was either complete surgery (n = 162), surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with 36-46Gy (n = 274), or definitive radiotherapy with 46-60Gy (n = 212). The median follow-up at the time of this analysis was 5.1 years, the maximum follow-up 16.5 years. ### results The overall survival of all patients including metastatic patients was 55% after 5 years, 48% after 10 years, and 37% after 15 years. Eight out of 674 patients (1.2%) developed a SM. Five of these were acute myelogenic leukemias (n = 4) or MDS (n = 1), and three were sarcomas. The interval between diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma and the diagnosis of the SM was 17-78 months for the four AMLs, 96 months for the MDS and 82-136 months for the three sarcomas. The cumulative risk of an SM was 0.7% after 5 years, 2.9% after 10 years, and 4.7% after 15 years. Out of five patients with AML/MDS, three died of rapid AML-progression, and two are living with disease. Local therapy (surgery vs. surgery plus postoperative irradiation vs. definitive radiotherapy) had no impact on the frequency of AML/MDS, but local therapy did influence the risk of secondary sarcomas. All three patients with secondary sarcomas had received radiotherapy; however, all three sarcomas were salvaged by subsequent treatment and are in clinical remission with a follow-up of 1 month, 4.3 years, and 7.5 years after the diagnosis of the secondary sarcoma. Thus far, SM contributed to less than 1 % (3/328) of all deaths in the CESS-studies. ### conclusions The risk of leukemia after treatment for Ewing's sarcoma is probably in the range of 2%. The risk of solid tumors also seems to be low within the first 10 years after treatment and remains in the range of 5 % after 15 years. In the CESS-studies, less than 1% of all deaths within the first 10 years after diagnosis were caused by SM. Effective salvage therapy for secondary sarcomas is feasible.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9788419/"}

Five clinical trials with temozolomide or dacarbazine have been performed in metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) with selection based on methyl-specific PCR ( MSP ) testing with modest results . We hypothesised that mitigated results are consequences of unspecific patient selection and that alternative methodologies for MGMT testing such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) could enhance patient enrolment. ### Patients And Methods Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded archival tumour tissue samples from four phase II studies of temozolomide or dacarbazine in MGMT MSP-positive mCRCs were analysed by IHC for MGMT protein expression and by methyl-BEAMing (MB) for percentage of promoter methylation.

Different antidepressant drugs are currently used for the treatment of depression in cancer patients, such as second-generation antidepressants and, recently, the extracts of Hypericum perforatum. These agents are susceptible to metabolically-based drug interactions with anticancer drugs. The aim of the present article is to provide an updated review of clinically relevant metabolic drug interactions between selected anticancer drugs and antidepressants, focusing on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and Hypericum extract. SSRIs can cause pharmacokinetic interactions through their in vitro ability to inhibit one or more cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs). SSRIs differ in their potential for metabolic drug interactions with anticancer drugs. Fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 and administration of these SSRIs reduces the clinical benefit of an anticancer drug , such as tamoxifen , by decreasing the formation of active metabolites of this drug . Women with breast cancer who receive paroxetine in combination with tamoxifen are at increased risk for death. Other SSRIs, including citalopram, escitalopram, are weak or negligible inhibitors of CYP2D6 and are less likely to interact with anticancer drugs, while sertraline causes significant inhibition of this isoform only at high doses. Hypericum extract, by inducing both the CYP3A4 and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), can reduce the plasma concentrations of different antineoplastic agents such as imatinib, irinotecan and docetaxel, thus reducing the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Although these interactions are often predictable, the use of fluoxetine, paroxetine and Hypericum extract should be avoided in cancer patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21395523/"}

The DNA from each sample was sequenced to high, uniform coverage. Immunohistochemical probes and morphoproteomics analysis were performed, in addition to fluorescence in situ hybridization. All analyses were performed in CLIA-certified laboratories. Molecularly targeted therapy based on the resulting profiles was offered to the patients. Biomedical analytics were performed using QIAGEN's Ingenuity\u00ae Pathway Analysis. ### results In Patient #1, comprehensive next-generation exome sequencing showed MET amplification, PIK3CA mutation, CCNE1 amplification, and PTPRD mutation. Immunohistochemistry-based morphoproteomic analysis revealed c-Met expression [(p)-c-Met (Tyr1234/1235)] and activation of mTOR/AKT pathway [IGF-1R (Tyr1165/1166), p-mTOR [Ser2448], p-Akt (Ser473)] and expression of SPARC and COX2.

We designed the EURAMOS-1 trial to investigate whether intensified postoperative chemotherapy for patients whose tumour showed a poor response to preoperative chemotherapy (\u226510% viable tumour) improved event-free survival in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma. ### methods EURAMOS-1 was an open-label, international, phase 3 randomised, controlled trial. Consenting patients with newly diagnosed, resectable, high-grade osteosarcoma aged 40 years or younger were eligible for randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either postoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (MAP) or MAP plus ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE) using concealed permuted blocks with three stratification factors: trial group; location of tumour (proximal femur or proximal humerus vs other limb vs axial skeleton); and presence of metastases (no vs yes or possible). The MAP regimen consisted of cisplatin 120 mg/m ### findings Between April 14, 2005, and June 30, 2011, 2260 patients were registered from 325 sites in 17 countries. 618 patients with poor response were randomly assigned; 310 to receive MAP and 308 to receive MAPIE. Median follow-up was 62\u00b71 months (IQR 46\u00b76-76\u00b76); 62\u00b73 months (IQR 46\u00b79-77\u00b71) for the MAP group and 61\u00b71 months (IQR 46\u00b75-75\u00b73) for the MAPIE group. 307 event-free survival events were reported (153 in the MAP group vs 154 in the MAPIE group). 193 deaths were reported (101 in the MAP group vs 92 in the MAPIE group). Event-free survival did not differ between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b798 [95% CI 0\u00b778-1\u00b723]); hazards were non-proportional (p=0\u00b70003). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (268 [89%] patients in MAP vs 268 [90%] in MAPIE), thrombocytopenia (231 [78% in MAP vs 248 [83%] in MAPIE), and febrile neutropenia without documented infection (149 [50%] in MAP vs 217 [73%] in MAPIE). MAPIE was associated with more frequent grade 4 non-haematological toxicity than MAP (35 [12%] of 301 in the MAP group vs 71 [24%] of 298 in the MAPIE group). Two patients died during postoperative therapy, one from infection (although their absolute neutrophil count was normal), which was definitely related to their MAP treatment (specifically doxorubicin and cisplatin), and one from left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which was probably related to MAPIE treatment (specifically doxorubicin). One suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction was reported in the MAP group: bone marrow infarction due to methotrexate. ### interpretation EURAMOS-1 results do not support the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to postoperative chemotherapy in patients with poorly responding osteosarcoma because its administration was associated with increased toxicity without improving event-free survival . The results define standard of care for this population. New strategies are required to improve outcomes in this setting. ### funding UK Medical Research Council, National Cancer Institute, European Science Foundation, St Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Vlaanderen, Parents Organization, Danish Medical Research Council, Academy of Finland, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Deutsche Krebshilfe, Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Semmelweis Foundation, ZonMw (Council for Medical Research), Research Council of Norway, Scandinavian Sarcoma Group, Swiss Paediatric Oncology Group, Cancer Research UK, National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals, and Biomedical Research Centre.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569442/"}

However , clindamycin possesses only one of the two mechanisms of lincomycin action , which is bacteriostatic , against Escherichia coli . The relative potency of action of a clindamycin-lincomycin combination against Staph. aureus is variable, and the effective ratio ranges between 5:1 and 9:1; the effective ratio against E. coli is fixed at 6:1 over a wide concentration range. This difference is attributed to differences in bioavailability and/or binding characteristics of the drugs for bioreceptors, as a consequence of structural modifications in the drug molecules, and to differences in modes of action in the respective organisms. Mixtures containing equipotent fractions of clindamycin and lincomycin show \"equivalence\" or \"indifference\" of effects on Staph. aureus. The combined action of the mixtures can be quantitatively predicted from the separate dose-response curves of either component drug alone. Therefore, it is concluded that clindamycin and lincomycin may bind to the same receptor site that is engaged in microbial protein synthesis to inhibit the generation of Staph. aureus. However, combinations of clindamycin and lincomycin are less active than the a priori equipotent concentration of either drug alone in their action against E. coli, demonstrating unequivocally an antagonism of effects. Furthermore, the degree of antagonism is dependent on the order of addition of the drugs, which is attributed to the possibility that clindamycin and lincomycin bind differently on active and allosteric loci of the same receptor site functionally engaged in protein synthesis in E. coli. A rational approach to the quantification and prediction of combined antibiotic action must, therefore, be based not only on the kinetics and mechanisms of action as well as on the dose-response relationship over a wide concentration range for the separate antibiotics but also on the strain and species of the test organism.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1102659/"}

Weekly administration of paclitaxel also appears to be better tolerated than 3-weekly administration. Single-agent weekly paclitaxel is associated with response rates of 20-65%. Combination therapy with weekly paclitaxel has mainly involved carboplatin and response rates with such regimens range from 60-88%.

Therefore, nanotechnology gained special attention as it has potential to improve patient compliance, bioavailability and reduction in dosing frequency. ### objective The aim of this study is to fabricate alginate-chitosan nanoparticles (AL-CS NPs) under appropriate conditions using ionic gelation method. The use of natural polymers in nanoparticle fabrication has a vast application due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility and nontoxic nature. Ionic gelation method involves the interaction between macromolecules with opposite charged ionizable groups forming polyelectrolyte complex. Hence, it is rational to formulate natural polymerbased sustained release nano-particulate matrix to improve patient adherence, reducing dose frequency and drug toxicity. ### method The formulations were based on 32 factorial designs. Nanoparticles of combined drug (isoniazid- INH and pyrazinamide-PYZ) were fabricated using natural polymer. Formulation process involved the use of pregelated sodium alginate followed by ionic gelation with chitosan. Pregelation of sodium alginate included calcium chloride.

We, therefore, studied -- in the same experiment from which the previous findings originated -- the effects of topiramate on the kinetic profile and hemodynamic response to methamphetamine.

Of all the IMiDs, clinical trial data are most mature for lenalidomide. In phase I studies, dose-limiting toxicities of lenalidomide were limited to myelosuppression and a response rate of 72% was seen in relapsed/refractory patients. Three phase II studies subsequently evaluated the efficacy of single-agent lenalidomide or lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone. As a single agent for post-transplant salvage therapy, lenalidomide 25 mg every 3 weeks has shown response rates as high as 44%.

In MM-007, median progression-free survival was 5.5 months at early analysis and the median overall survival has yet to be reached. Preliminary data for the single-arm, multicenter, open-label MM-014 study showed that median time to progression was 5.6 months.

Chronic pain in the elderly is frequently a result of arthritic disorders, particularly osteoarthritis. The cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are as effective as standard NSAIDs for the relief of pain and for improving function in elderly patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of serious gastroduodenal adverse reactions but there is evidence that they carry a lower risk for these adverse effects than standard NSAIDs, except when there is concurrent aspirin use. Since gastroduodenal disorders are the most frequently reported serious adverse effects of NSAIDs and these disorders occur more frequently in the elderly, COX-2 inhibitors offer an alternative to standard NSAIDs in this age group. However, they are not appropriate for many patients with cardiovascular and renal disease. The adverse reaction profile of the COX-2 inhibitors has confirmed the role of the COX-2 enzyme in renal function, salt and water homeostasis and the vascular endothelium. Thus, like standard NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause renal failure, hypertension and exacerbation of cardiac failure. Of note is that these disorders are dose related. Thus, there are good reasons to avoid high doses of COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly. Clinical trials indicate that daily doses of rofecoxib 12.5 mg, celecoxib 100-200 mg, valdecoxib 10mg and etoricoxib 60 mg are the minimum effective doses of these agents. Data from the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme indicate that celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day are/were the most commonly prescribed doses and that 6 % of patients had taken rofecoxib 50 mg/day for longer than recommended . Recent research indicates that COX-2 inhibitors have a thrombotic potential, especially in high doses and when use is prolonged, and this further limits the extent to which they can be used in the elderly. Important interactions with COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly include those with warfarin, which can result in loss of control of anticoagulation, and those with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists and diuretics, which can result in loss of control of blood pressure and cardiac failure and, in hypovolaemic conditions, renal failure. The clinical significance of an interaction between celecoxib and aspirin to reduce the antiplatelet effect of the latter drug is unknown. Preliminary information from spontaneous reporting systems indicates that there may be differences in the risk of cardiac failure and hypertension between standard NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors and between rofecoxib and celecoxib. More formal studies using equivalent doses are needed to test this observation. Use of COX-2 inhibitors may be considered in the elderly to reduce the risk of gastroduodenal complications associated with standard NSAIDs but only when consideration has first been given to use of less toxic medicines as alternatives or supplements, the appropriate dose of the COX-2 inhibitor or standard NSAID, the presence and possible impact of co-morbidities, and the implications of taking COX-2 inhibitors with any concomitant medications. Equally important is regular monitoring of the patient taking a COX-2 inhibitor for efficacy and adverse effects, and ensuring that the patient has a continuing need to keep taking the drug. Close attention also needs to be paid to intercurrent illnesses and new prescriptions that may reduce the safety of the COX-2 inhibitor. A standard NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor may be equally effective as a COX-2 inhibitor in reducing the risk of gastroduodenal toxicity and if used the same prescribing advice applies. Current knowledge concerning the thrombotic potential of COX-2 inhibitors suggests that this combination, if tolerated, may be preferable to a COX-2 inhibitor, particularly where prolonged use is required. This knowledge also indicates that for patients with or at high risk of ischaemic heart disease or stroke, COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15813652/"}

Immunosuppression included 1.5 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone and 1.0 mg/kg per day azathioprine. CsA (n=5) was adjusted to trough levels of 300-500 ng/ml, tacrolimus (n=5) was adjusted to 16-26 ng/ml. All immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued on postoperative day (POD) 28. Allograft survival was monitored by sequential chest radiographs, bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy histology. Peripheral blood leukocytes were scanned for donor chimerism and CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD25 expression. ### results The animals survived a 4-week course of immunosuppression without radiological or histological signs of rejection on POD 28. Median allograft survival in CsA-treated animals was 55+/-15 days and all animals rejected their grafts within 42 days after withdrawal of immunosuppression. In tacrolimus-treated animals, median survival was 152+/-65 days with the longest survivor being electively sacrificed on POD 390 (P=0.0064). The degree of donor leukocyte chimerism and the frequency of CD4+CD25+ T-cells were higher in the tacrolimus group, however, these differences were not statistically significant. ### conclusion The results of our study show that primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus is superior to cyclosporine after pulmonary allotransplantation in a large animal model.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16054825/"}

Our re-analysis relied on standard equivalence methods in which interpretation is based on Relative Risks (RRs) along with their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). The equivalence margins employed in our statistical testing were directly derived from those reported in randomized studies. ### results The equivalence margins were initially set at RR ranging from 0.775 to 1.29. According to these margins, triple therapy based on any NOAC proved to be superior to dual therapy alone, but at the same time demonstrated its equivalence with dual therapy. The results for apixaban-based triple therapy were inconclusive (not superior, not not-inferior, not equivalent and, of course, not inferior to the controls). Those for rivaroxaban-based triple therapy showed that this combination treatment was superior to dual therapy alone and failed to meet the criterion of equivalence. In the comparison between rivaroxaban-based triple therapy and ticagrelor + aspirin , the RR was 1 and its 95 % CI remained within a post-hoc margin of \u00b1 15 % . ### conclusions Even if one considers the most effective NOAC in combination with clopidogrel + ticagrelor, this triple therapy is not more effective than ticagrelor + aspirin. On the other hand, the increased risk of bleeding with triple regimens is well demonstrated.

In humans, however, the effects of oxytocin appear more nuanced and influenced by social context and personality traits.

The latter contraction is due to the release of neuropeptides from airway sensory nerves. ketotifen fumarate has been demonstrated to inhibit the noncholinergic contraction in guinea pig airways in vitro, but no attempt has been made to identify the receptor type. Therefore we have performed an in vitro study to investigate which receptor is responsible for the inhibitory effects of ketotifen on noncholinergic contraction in guinea pig airways. ketotifen (3 to 100 mumol/L) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the noncholinergic contraction, with a maximum inhibition of 74% +/- 7% at 8 Hz stimulation (p < 0.001; n = 5).

However, the overall efficacies of TKIs are limited due to the development of drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to elucidate mechanisms of EGFR and c-Met TKI resistance in order to develop more effective therapies. Model NSCLC cell lines H1975 and H2170 were used to study the similarities and differences in mechanisms of EGFR/c-Met TKI resistance. H1975 cells are positive for the T790M EGFR mutation, which confers resistance to current EGFR TKI therapies, while H2170 cells are EGFR wild-type. Previously, H2170 cells were made resistant to the EGFR TKI erlotinib and the c-Met TKI SU11274 by exposure to progressively increasing concentrations of TKIs.

This report reviews the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, agents that inhibit tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), when used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults. ### Data Sources Electronic databases were searched up to February 2005. ### Review Methods Systematic reviews of the literature on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were undertaken and industry submissions to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) were reviewed. Meta-analyses of effectiveness data were also undertaken for each agent. The Birmingham Rheumatoid Arthritis Model (BRAM), a simulation model, was further developed and used to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. ### results Twenty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), most of high quality, were included. The only head-to-head comparisons were against methotrexate. For patients with short disease duration (<or=3 years) who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, adalimumab was marginally less and etanercept was marginally more effective than methotrexate in reducing symptoms of RA. etanercept was better tolerated than methotrexate. Both adalimumab and etanercept were more effective than methotrexate in slowing radiographic joint damage . etanercept was also marginally more effective and better tolerated than methotrexate in patients with longer disease durations who had not failed methotrexate treatment. infliximab is only licensed for use with methotrexate. All three agents, either alone (where so licensed) or in combination with ongoing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), were effective in reducing the symptoms and signs of RA in patients with established disease. At the licensed dose, the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) (95% CI) required to produce an American College for Rheumatology (ACR) response compared with placebo were: ACR20: adalimumab 3.6 (3.1 to 4.2), etanercept 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4), infliximab 3.2 (2.7 to 4.0); ACR50: adalimumab 4.2 (3.7 to 5.0), etanercept 3.1 (2.7 to 3.6), infliximab 5.0 (3.8 to 6.7); and ACR70: adalimumab 7.7 (5.9 to 11.1), etanercept 7.7 (6.3 to 10.0), infliximab 11.1 (7.7 to 20.0). In patients who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, or who had not previously failed methotrexate treatment, a TNF inhibitor combined with methotrexate was significantly more effective than methotrexate alone. infliximab combined with methotrexate had an increased risk of serious infections. All ten published economic evaluations met standard criteria for quality, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from being within established thresholds to being very high because of varying assumptions and parameters. All three sponsors who submitted economic models made assumptions favourable to their product. BRAM incorporates improvements in quality of life and mortality, but assumes no effect of TNF inhibitors on joint replacement. For use in accordance with current NICE guidance as the third DMARD in a sequence of DMARDs, the base-case ICER was around pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in early RA and pound50,000 per QALY in late RA. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were sensitive to the estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression while on TNF inhibitors and the effectiveness of DMARDs, but not to changes in mortality ratios per unit HAQ. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used last. The ICER for etanercept used last is pound24,000 per QALY, substantially lower than for adalimumab ( pound30,000 per QALY) or infliximab ( pound38,000 per QALY). First line use as monotherapy generates ICERs around pound50,000 per QALY for adalimumab and etanercept. Using the combination of methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor as first line treatment generates much higher ICERs, as it precludes subsequent use of methotrexate, which is cheap. The ICERs for sequential use are of the same order as using the TNF inhibitor alone. ### conclusions adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are effective treatments compared with placebo for RA patients who are not well controlled by conventional DMARDs, improving control of symptoms, improving physical function, and slowing radiographic changes in joints. The combination of a TNF inhibitor with methotrexate was more effective than methotrexate alone in early RA, although the clinical relevance of this additional benefit is yet to be established, particularly in view of the well-established effectiveness of MTX alone. An increased risk of serious infection cannot be ruled out for the combination of methotrexate with adalimumab or infliximab. The results of the economic evaluation based on BRAM are consistent with the observations from the review of clinical effectiveness, including the ranking of treatments. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used as last active therapy. In this analysis, other things being equal, etanercept may be the TNF inhibitor of choice, although this may also depend on patient preference as to route of administration. The next most cost-effective use of TNF inhibitors is third line, as recommended in the 2002 NICE guidance. Direct comparative RCTs of TNF inhibitors against each other and against other DMARDs, and sequential use in patients who have failed a previous TNF inhibitor, are needed. Longer term studies of the quality of life in patients with RA and the impact of DMARDs on this are needed, as are longer studies that directly assess effects on joint replacement, other morbidity and mortality.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17049139/"}

The treatment paradigm of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed rapidly in recent years. In first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk patients , the CheckMate 214 study demonstrated a significant survival advantage for nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib . The high cost of combined immune-modulating agents warrants an understanding of the combination's value by considering both efficacy and cost. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab compared with sunitinib for first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk advanced RCC from the U.S. payer perspective. ### Materials And Methods A Markov model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab with those of sunitinib in the first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk advanced RCC. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Drug costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates in 2017. We extrapolated survival beyond the trial closure using Weibull distribution. Model robustness was addressed in univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. ### results The total mean cost per-patient of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib was $292,308 and $169,287, respectfully. nivolumab and ipilimumab generated a gain of 0.978 QALYs over sunitinib. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for nivolumab and ipilimumab was $125,739/QALY versus sunitinib. ### conclusion Our analysis established that the base case ICER in the model for nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib is below what some would consider the upper limit of the theoretical willingness-to-pay threshold in the U.S. ($150,000/QALY) and is thus estimated to be cost-effective. ### Implications For Practice This article assessed the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib for treatment of patients with intermediate- to poor-risk metastatic kidney cancer, from the U.S. payer perspective. It would cost $125,739 to gain 1 quality-adjusted life-year with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib in these patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30710066/"}

Taxanes are one of the most powerful classes of compounds among all chemotherapeutic drugs. Only 30 years separate the isolation of the first taxane from the results of direct clinical comparisons in metastatic breast, ovarian, and lung cancer between the two taxanes available in routine clinical practice. These results suggest a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio for docetaxel compared to paclitaxel when these drugs are used as single agents or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in an every-3-week dosing regimen. Pharmacological data support the difference between the taxanes, likely explaining the clinical results. Considering the molecular pharmacology of the two drugs, docetaxel appears to bind to beta-tubulin with greater affinity and has a wider cell cycle activity than paclitaxel. docetaxel also appears to have direct antitumoral activity via an apoptotic effect mediated by bcl-2 phosphorylation. In addition , docetaxel has a longer retention time in tumor cells than paclitaxel because of greater uptake and slower efflux . Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the taxanes show both agents to be extensively metabolized in the liver, and paclitaxel has a nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior while docetaxel has linear pharmacokinetics. These differences explain the more simple treatment schedule and favorable results for docetaxel as a single agent and in combination therapy. Last, but not least, there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between paclitaxel and the anthracyclines, an active class of compounds commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer. This pharmacokinetic interaction is associated with greater cardio- and myelotoxicities, which are sequence dependent. These pharmacological data likely explain the different clinical development strategies for the two molecules as well as the different clinical results from individual trials and direct comparisons.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15161985/"}

Breast cancer is associated with high levels of incidence, morbidity and mortality; therefore, the identification of effective chemopreventive strategies is crucial. It is important for clinicians to be able to identify the populations at risk who would benefit from chemoprevention, and the interventions that are effective and safe. The aim of the present study was to investigate the combined effects of simvastatin and exemestane on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells . The anti-proliferative effects of simvastatin and exemestane, alone and in combination, on the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were assessed by MTT assay. The synergism between the two drugs was determined in vitro using the combination index (CI) analysis. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, and alterations to the signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells were examined by immunoblotting following treatment with various regimens. The results of the MTT assay indicated that the combined treatment of simvastatin and exemestane significantly decreased the viability of MCF-7 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) human breast cancer cells, as compared with those that were treated with the individual drugs (CI<1). In addition, coadministration of exemestane and simvastatin was shown to result in marked inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, significant cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and induction of apoptosis, as compared with that of the control and individual drug-treated cells. Furthermore, the results of the present study indicated that these synergistic effects may be associated with the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein apoptotic pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6 kinase growth pathway.

Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the molecular effects of PZQ on schistosomes and to investigate alternative or synergistic drugs against schistosomiasis. ### methodology We used a custom-designed Schistosoma mansoni expression microarray to explore the effects of sublethal doses of PZQ on large-scale gene expression of adult paired males and females and unpaired mature females. We also assessed the efficacy of PZQ, omeprazole (OMP) or their combination against S. mansoni adult worms with a survival in vitro assay. ### Principal Findings We identified sets of genes that were affected by PZQ in paired and unpaired mature females, however with opposite gene expression patterns (up-regulated in paired and down-regulated in unpaired mature females), indicating that PZQ effects are heavily influenced by the mating status. We also identified genes that were similarly affected by PZQ in males and females. Functional analyses of gene interaction networks were performed with parasite genes that were differentially expressed upon PZQ treatment, searching for proteins encoded by these genes whose human homologs are targets of different drugs used for other diseases. Based on these results, OMP, a widely prescribed proton pump inhibitor known to target the ATP1A2 gene product, was chosen and tested.

PARP inhibitors have moved into clinical practice in the past few years, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) within the past 2 years.

The potent CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine has recently been shown also to be an effective inhibitor of the CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of the antimalarial drug proguanil in vivo. The purpose of the present study was to confirm this interaction in vitro. ### methods A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to assay 4-chlorophenylbiguanide (4-CPBG) and cycloguanil formed from proguanil by microsomes prepared from human liver. The limit of detection was 0.08 nmol mg-'. h-I. ### results The formation of 4-CPBG and cycloguanil could be described by one-enzyme kinetics, indicating that the formation of the two metabolites is almost exclusively catalysed by a single enzyme, i.e. CYP2C19 within the concentration range used, or that the contribution of an alternative low-affinity enzyme, probably CYP3A4, is very low. This notion was confirmed by the lack of potent inhibition by four CYP3A4 inhibitors: ketoconazole, bromocriptine, midazolam and dihydroergotamine. fluvoxamine was a very effective inhibitor of the oxidation of proguanil, displaying Ki values of 0.69 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of cycloguanil formation and 4.7 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of 4-CPBG formation. As expected, the CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole inhibited the formation of both metabolites with an IC50 of 10 micromol x l(-1). Norfluoxetine and sulfaphenazole inhibited proguanil oxidation with Ki values of 7.3-16 micromol x l(-1), suggesting that the two compounds are moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19. ### conclusions Fluvoxamine is a fairly potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and it has the potential for causing drug-drug interactions with substrates for CYP2C19 such as imipramine , clomipramine , amitriptyline and diazepam . The combination of fluvoxamine and proguanil can not be recommended.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9923577/"}

Experience and preliminary results of a phase I/II trial with topotecan and vinorelbine. Platinum-based chemotherapy is considered standard treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Over the past decade , paclitaxel , docetaxel , vinorelbine , gemcitabine , irinotecan , and topotecan have been introduced into the clinic . These newer agents have shown promising activity against NSCLC with a favorable toxicity profile as single agents. For patients with metastatic NSCLC, palliation is the main goal of therapy. Therefore, treatment should be easy to administer on an outpatient basis. We explored a novel combination therapy avoiding platinum. Patients with recurrent or metastatic NSCLC were treated with intravenous (i.v.) topotecan (0.5-1.0 mg/m(2)/day x 5) and i.v. vinorelbine (20-30 mg/m(2)/day on day 1 and day 5) in 21-day cycles. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined separately with or without the addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. Twenty-nine patients have been enrolled to date. At i.v. topotecan doses of 0.75-1.0 mg/m(2)/day and i.v. vinorelbine of 25 mg/m(2)/day, neutropenia was frequent but of short duration (<7 days). The DLT of i.v. topotecan (0.85 mg/m(2)) in the absence of G-CSF support was based on myelosuppression with neutropenic fever. With the addition of G-CSF, a DLT has not been reached. Nonhematologic toxicities included mild to moderate fatigue and constipation. An overall clinical response rate of 42% was achieved, with responses noted at all dose levels. At a short median follow-up of 15 months, the median survival for all patients is 13 months. In conclusion, the combination regimen of topotecan and vinorelbine is feasible for outpatient administration and is well tolerated with less toxicity than platinum-based regimens.

Systemic ( i.v . ) pretreatment with furosemide ( 2 - 10 mg kg-1 ) increased urine volume and dose-dependently inhibited the pressor response to i.c.v . clonidine ( 10 micrograms ) , and a long-lasting depressor response to clonidine was observed . However, furosemide treatment did not alter the bradycardia produced in response to clonidine. 4. The systemic treatment with furosemide (10 mg kg-1, i.v.) had no effect on the pressor response to i.v. noradrenaline. 5. These results suggest that reduction of body fluid volume inhibits the centrally-mediated pressor response to clonidine and leads to the hypotensive effect. We also suggest that combined treatment with a diuretic increases the hypotensive efficacy of clonidine.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1797326/"}

The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to compare the survival, toxicity, and quality of life of patients treated with necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. These agents were investigated in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first-line setting. ### methods The systematic review was executed on January 27, 2015, and updated on August 21, 2016, using a pre-specified search strategy. Searches were conducted using PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE, with supplemental searches using the Evidence Based Medicine Reviews and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs published in English from 1995-2016 and reporting at least one of the primary outcomes [overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, or quality of life] in patients who received first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool, respectively. A Baysian network meta-analysis was performed on the primary outcomes. Hazard ratios (HRs) were evaluated for the primary analysis; secondary analyses were conducted using median OS data. Planned sensitivity analyses were conducted including reanalysis using a Frequentist approach and limiting analyses to subsets based on clinical and demographic covariates. ### results The systematic literature review resulted in identification of 4,016 unique publications; 40 publications (35 unique trials) were eligible for inclusion. Eight studies connected to a common network for the OS analysis using HR data. The majority of studies were not limited to squamous NSCLC, thus analyzable data were limited to a subset of data within the published trials. carboplatin + S-1 and necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin were associated with lower HRs for OS versus all other comparators. Nine studies connected to the network for the PFS analysis in which necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin was associated with the lowest HR . Data were not available to analyze toxicity or quality of life. ### conclusions Although the results suggest that carboplatin + S-1 and necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin may have value in terms of OS versus other comparators, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of studies (with few focused exclusively on squamous NSCLC) and wide credible intervals.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30746213/"}

The majority of glioblastomas have aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways and malignant glioma cells are thought to be addicted to these signaling pathways for their survival and proliferation. However, recent studies suggest that monotherapies or inappropriate combination therapies using the molecular targeted drugs have limited efficacy possibly because of tumor heterogeneities, signaling redundancy and crosstalk in intracellular signaling network, indicating necessity of rationale and methods for efficient personalized combination treatments. Here, we evaluated the growth of colonies obtained from glioma tumor-initiating cells (GICs) derived from glioma sphere culture (GSC) in agarose and examined the effects of combination treatments on GICs using targeted drugs that affect the signaling pathways to which most glioma cells are addicted. ### methods Human GICs were cultured in agarose and treated with inhibitors of RTKs, non-receptor kinases or transcription factors. The colony number and volume were analyzed using a colony counter, and Chou-Talalay combination indices were evaluated. Autophagy and apoptosis were also analyzed. Phosphorylation of proteins was evaluated by reverse phase protein array and immunoblotting. ### results Increases of colony number and volume in agarose correlated with the Gompertz function. GICs showed diverse drug sensitivity, but inhibitions of RTK and RAF/MEK or PI3K by combinations such as EGFR inhibitor and MEK inhibitor, sorafenib and U0126, erlotinib and BKM120, and EGFR inhibitor and sorafenib showed synergy in different subtypes of GICs.

Reverse phase protein array analysis of the synergistic treatment indicated involvement of not only MEK and PI3K signaling pathways but also others associated with glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, gene transcription, histone methylation, iron transport, stress response, cell cycle, and apoptosis. ### conclusion Inhibiting RTK and RAF/MEK or PI3K could induce synergistic cytotoxicity but personalization is necessary. Examining colonies in agarose initiated by GICs from each patient may be useful for drug sensitivity testing in personalized cancer therapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26861698/"}

Given this activity, it seemed logical to attempt to combine paclitaxel with doxorubicin, the other most active single agent in metastatic breast cancer. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performed two trials investigating paclitaxel/doxorubicin combinations in patients with advanced breast cancer in an attempt to identify a tolerable dose and schedule of the combination. In the first trial , paclitaxel and doxorubicin were alternated every 3 weeks in doses of 200 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 , respectively , for patients who had received no more than one prior chemotherapeutic regimen . Therapy was well tolerated in this setting. At these doses, paclitaxel induced more granulocytopenia and less thrombocytopenia than did doxorubicin. Objective responses (complete and partial responses) were seen in seven of 12 patients; two other patients had improved disease (relief of pain in bony metastases). A second limited-institution Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial evaluated paclitaxel and doxorubicin given in combination. In this phase I trial, doxorubicin was given as an intravenous push and paclitaxel as a 24-hour continuous infusion. The sequence of drug administration (D-->P or P-->D) was alternated both between and within patients, so that we might evaluate the effect of administration schedule on toxicity. Therapy was begun at an initial paclitaxel dose of 150 mg/m2 and an initial doxorubicin dose of 50 mg/m2 in six patients, with a subsequent six patients receiving 175 and 60 mg/m2, respectively, of paclitaxel and doxorubicin. In addition, patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d. While therapy at the initial dose level was well tolerated, dose-limiting mucositis was seen at the second dose level, although only when paclitaxel preceded doxorubicin. This suggests that sequence of drug administration in paclitaxel-based regimens may play an important role as a determinant of toxicity and (perhaps) efficacy, a finding similar to that seen when paclitaxel and cisplatin were combined in patients with ovarian cancer. Based on this study, we identified the sequence of doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) followed by paclitaxel (150 mg/m2) to be the maximum tolerated dose. This combination is currently being compared with paclitaxel alone and doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced breast cancer in an intergroup trial led by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7939756/"}

Our aim was to better characterize the profiles of efficacy and safety of currently available adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, including drugs currently in development. ### methods We performed a systematic review of the literature regarding adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, focusing on novel drugs. ### results Currently available adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors , including ketoconazole , metyrapone , etomidate , and mitotane , have variable efficacy and significant side effects , and none are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CS . Therefore, there is a clear need for novel, prospectively studied agents that have greater efficacy and a low rate of adverse side effects. Efficacy and safety data of current and emerging adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, including osilodrostat (LCI699) and levoketoconazole (COR-003), show promising results that will have to be confirmed in larger-scale phase 3 studies (currently ongoing). ### conclusions The management of CS, and particularly CD, remains challenging. Adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors can be of major interest to control the hypercortisolism at any time point, either before or after surgery, as discussed in this review.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27600150/"}

When seven intermediate signal durations, to which responses were not reinforced, were randomly interspersed the probability of a right-lever ('long') response increased as a function of signal duration. methamphetamine shifted this psychometric function leftward and decreased its slope: haloperidol also decreased the slope but shifted the function rightward. A combination of haloperidol and methamphetamine led to a function similar to the saline control function. The leftward shift probably reflects an increase in the speed of an internal clock, and the rightward shift probably reflects a decrease in its speed. Since methamphetamine releases several catecholamines, including dopamine, and haloperidol blocks dopamine receptors, it is plausible that the horizontal location of the psychometric function (the speed of the clock) is related to the effective level of dopamine.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6403957/"}

In the lenalidomide and LR arms, grade 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 58% and 53% of patients, with 9% and 11% of patients experiencing grade 4 toxicity, respectively; grade 3 to 4 adverse events included neutropenia (16% v 20%, respectively), fatigue (9% v 13%, respectively), and thrombosis (16% [n = 7] v 4% [n = 2], respectively; P = .157). Thirty-six percent of lenalidomide patients and 63% of LR patients completed 12 cycles. lenalidomide alone was associated with more treatment failures, with 22% of patients discontinuing treatment as a result of adverse events. Dose-intensity exceeded 80% in both arms. Overall response rate was 53% (20% complete response) and 76% (39% complete response) for lenalidomide alone and LR, respectively (P = .029). At the median follow-up of 2.5 years, median time to progression was 1.1 year for lenalidomide alone and 2 years for LR (P = .0023). ### conclusion LR is more active than lenalidomide alone in recurrent FL with similar toxicity, warranting further study in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma as a platform for addition of novel agents.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26304886/"}

A recently developed taxane-cabazitaxel-has poor affinity for P-gp and is thereby effective in docetaxel-resistant CRPC. It has been recently demonstrated that exosomes in the body fluids could serve as a diagnostic marker because they contain proteins and RNAs specific to the cells from which they are derived. In this study, we aimed to investigate if P-gp in blood exosomes could be a marker to diagnose docetaxel resistance and select a taxoid for patients with CRPC. ### Methods And Materials Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer (PC-3) cells (PC-3R) and their parental PC-3 cells and from the serum of patients. Silencing of P-gp was performed by small interfering RNA transfection. Protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis.

Here, we report 4-year survival and outcomes after retreatment, and the role of tumour mutational burden (TMB) in identifying patients who might have a better outcome in response to combined therapy. ### methods NIBIT-MESO-1 was an open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial of patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma who received intravenous tremelimumab (1 mg/kg bodyweight) and durvalumab (20 mg/kg bodyweight) every 4 weeks for four doses, followed by maintenance intravenous durvalumab at the same dose and schedule for nine doses. In this follow-up study, patients with disease progression following initial clinical benefit-ie, a partial repsonse or stable disease-were eligible for retreatment and with the same doses and schedules for tremelimumab and durvalumab as used in the NIBIT-MESO-1 trial. The primary endpoint, immune-related objective response rate, was evaluated per immune-related modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or immune-related RECIST 1.1 criteria for patients with pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma, respectively. Key secondary endpoints were overall survival and safety, and TMB was also evaluated post hoc in patients who had tumour tissue available before treatment.

This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02588131. ### findings 40 patients were enrolled in the NIBIT-MESO-1 study between Oct 30, 2015, and Oct 12, 2016. At data cut-off, April 30, 2020, five (13%) of 40 patients were alive, and 35 (88%) patients had died of progressive disease. At a median follow-up of 52 months (IQR 49-53), median overall survival was 16\u00b75 months (95% CI 13\u00b77-19\u00b72). Survival was 20% (eight of 40 patients) at 36 months and 15% (six of 40 patients) and 48 months. 17 (43%) of 40 patients met the criteria for enrolment in the retreatment study and were retreated with at least one dose of tremelimumab and durvalumab. No immune-related objective responses were observed in the 17 retreated patients. Seven (41%) of 17 patients achieved immune-related stable disease. From the start of retreatment to a median follow-up of 24 months (22\u00b70-25\u00b70), median overall survival was 12\u00b75 months (95% CI 0\u00b70-25\u00b78), and survival at 12 months was 52\u00b79%, at 18 months was 35\u00b73%, and at 24 months was 23\u00b75%. There were no grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events in the retreatment cohort. In a post-hoc analysis of 28 patients for whom tumour tissue before treatment was available, patients with a TMB higher than the median value of 8\u00b73 mutations per Mb had a higher median overall survival compared with patients with TMB below the median value, but this difference was non-significant.

Secondary end points were overall survival, occurrence of adverse events, tolerability, and status of lymph node dissection. ### results Among 788 eligible patients , the median ( SD ) age was 59 ( 22 - 74 ) years ; 263 patients were assigned to doxorubicin plus cisplatin treatment , 263 patients to docetaxel plus cisplatin treatment , and 262 patients to paclitaxel plus carboplatin treatment . The number of patients who did not complete 6 cycles was 53 (20.1%) for the doxorubicin plus cisplatin group, 45 (17.1%) for the docetaxel plus cisplatin group, and 63 (24.0%) for the paclitaxel plus carboplatin group. Tolerability of these regimens were not statistically different. After a median follow-up period of 7 years, there was no statistical difference of progression-free survival (doxorubicin plus cisplatin, 191; docetaxel plus cisplatin, 208; paclitaxel plus carboplatin, 187; P\u2009=\u2009.12) or overall survival (doxorubicin plus cisplatin, 217; docetaxel plus cisplatin, 223; paclitaxel plus carboplatin, 215; P\u2009=\u2009.67) among the 3 groups.
