On the first post-operative day she became septic due to a surgical wound infection. Despite being treated according to the therapeutic protocols for sepsis, no clinical improvement was noticed and further assessment revealed an underlying immunodeficiency. Considering the underlying immunodeficiency and to that point poor clinical response, an antifungal agent was added to the antibiotic regiment. Following discontinuation of multiple antifungal agents due to adverse effects, posaconazole was administered. posaconazole oral intake was followed by episodes of bradycardia and QT interval prolongation. The patient suffered continuous incidents of cardiac arrest due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades des pointes) that degenerated to lethal ventricular fibrillation. posaconazole was immediately discontinued and a temporary pacemaker was installed. The patient finally recovered without any neurological deficit, and was discharged in a good clinical status. ### conclusions Close cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases where posaconazole administration is combined with coexisting risk factors, as they may lead to severe ECG abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias such as long QT interval syndrome and torsades de pointes. posaconazole interactions with medications metabolized via the CYP3A4 pathway should be considered an additional risk factor for lethal cardiac incidents.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27125217/"}

LV pressures, left atrial pressures, and regional segment lengths were measured in anterior and posterior midwall. A cylindrical ultrasound probe (0.9 MHz, 25 W) mounted on a catheter was inserted into the LV cavity through the apex and was activated for 4 minutes in each condition. In protocol A (n = 7), LV volume was altered with caval vein occlusion and intravenous dextran infusion. The ultrasound probe was activated at low (4.1 +/- 0.9 mm Hg), mid (10.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), and high (17.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP). Effects of ultrasound were less pronounced at higher EDP. For example, the time interval from end-diastole to peak (-)dP/dt decreased by 7.5 +/- 2.3% at low, 4.4 +/- 2.2% at mid, and 1.9 +/- 1.6% at high LVEDP (p < 0.001). In protocol B (n = 7), LV inotropic state was altered by slow intravenous infusion of low-dose calcium. The ultrasound probe was activated before and after calcium. Effects of ultrasound were less pronounced after calcium. Time from end-diastole to peak (-)dP/dt decreased by 8.4 +/- 3.1% at baseline and by 3.5 +/- 2.1% after calcium (p < 0.001). In protocol C (n = 7), activation of the ultrasound probe was performed at baseline and after mild selective alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation (propranolol plus phenylephrine).

To determine an OBD (based on a gene re-expression end point), 14 patients received decitabine alone for 10 days. To determine the MTD, 11 patients received decitabine (at OBD, days 1 through 10) plus dose-escalating VA (days 5 through 21). ### results The OBD of decitabine was 20 mg/m(2)/d intravenously, with limited nonhematologic toxicity.

The key GGR component XPC does not respond to DNA damage in melanoma, the cause of this lack of response has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the role of methylation in reduced XPC in melanoma. ### methods To reduce methylation and induce DNA-damage, melanoma cell lines were treated with decitabine and carboplatin, individually and sequentially. Global DNA methylation levels, XPC mRNA and protein expression and methylation of the XPC promoter were examined. Apoptosis, cell proliferation and senescence were also quantified. XPC siRNA was used to determine that the responses seen were reliant on XPC induction. ### results Treatment with high-dose decitabine resulted in global demethylation, including the the shores of the XPC CpG island and significantly increased XPC mRNA expression. Lower, clinically relevant dose of decitabine also resulted in global demethylation including the CpG island shores and induced XPC in 50% of cell lines. decitabine followed by DNA-damaging carboplatin treatment led to significantly higher XPC expression in 75% of melanoma cell lines tested. Combined sequential treatment also resulted in a greater apoptotic response in 75% of cell lines compared to carboplatin alone, and significantly slowed cell proliferation, with some melanoma cell lines going into senescence. Inhibiting the increased XPC using siRNA had a small but significant negative effect, indicating that XPC plays a partial role in the response to sequential decitabine and carboplatin. ### conclusions Demethylation using decitabine increased XPC and apoptosis after sequential carboplatin.

Most beta-blockers reduce resting heart rate by approximately 25 to 30 beats/min, although a lesser reduction is seen with those possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as oxprenolol and pindolol. While earlier studies employing large doses of intravenous propranolol concluded that beta-blockade reduced myocardial contractility, more recent non-invasive studies suggest that the predominant cardiac effect is on heart rate. In patients with cardiac failure, beta-blockers may, however, produce a profound fall in cardiac output. Nevertheless, in combination with digoxin they may be useful in controlling the atrial fibrillation of thyrocardiac disease. beta-Blockers improve nervousness and tremor (although to a lesser extent with cardioselective agents) and severe myopathy, and they also reduce the frequency of paralysis in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. There is often subjective improvement in sweating but usually no major effect on eye signs. Recent studies show a 10% reduction in oxygen consumption/basal metabolic rate with long term oral use of selective or nonselective beta-blockers. In addition, many agents (propranolol, metoprolol, nadolol and sotalol but not acebutolol, atenolol or oxprenolol) reduce circulating tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentration by between 10 and 40%, although the clinical significance of this effect (if any) is not established. beta-Blockers may also have endocrinological effects on gastrin, cyclic AMP, catecholamines and other hormone levels. Given in adequate dosage, propranolol has been shown to control thyrotoxic hypercalcaemia. Minor side effects (nausea, headaches, tiredness, etc.) are quite common but overall beta-blockers are well tolerated by the thyrotoxic patient. The major use of these drugs is in symptomatic control while awaiting definitive diagnosis or treatment. As an adjunct to antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine, beta-blockers will produce a satisfactory clinical response in the weeks to months before these forms of therapy produce a euthyroid state. beta-Blockers are more convenient than antithyroid drugs in the control of patients receiving therapeutic radioiodine, in that continuous therapy and assessment of biochemical response is possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6144501/"}

Although gefitinib combined with various cytotoxic agents has been reported to enhance cytotoxicity in vitro and in mouse models, the mechanism remains undetermined. Here, to explore the mechanism with topoisomerase I inhibitors, we focused on the efflux pump of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), and then examined whether gefitinib restored drug sensitivity in multidrug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing BCRP. We used PC-6 human small cell lung cancer cells and multidrug-resistant PC-6/SN2-5H cells selected with SN-38 of the active metabolite of irinotecan, and BCRP-overexpressing MCF-7/MX cells selected with mitoxantrone and BCRP cDNA transfectant MCF-7/clone 8 cells. Drug sensitivity against anticancer drugs was determined by tetrazolium dye assay, and intracellular topotecan accumulation by FACScan. The topotecan transport study was done using the plasma membrane vesicles of PC-6/SN2-5H cells. The resistant PC-6/SN2-5H cells overexpressed BCRP but not epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA. Ten micromoles of gefitinib reversed topotecan , SN-38 , and mitoxantrone resistance , and increased the intracellular topotecan accumulation in the resistant cells but not in the parental cells .

Proof of concept in animal models. In the present work, we have evaluated the possibility of preventing liver carcinogenesis in rats at two stages of development. In the first series of experiments, we induced foci of altered hepatocytes, (FAH) which represent the first events in rodent liver carcinogenesis, using the chemical mutagens diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and acetylaminofluorene (AAF). In the second part of the work, we used repeated weekly injections of DEN only that gave rise to significant fibrosis at 11 weeks and the development of malignant tumours at 16 weeks. We chose to assess the chemopreventive effect of three different drugs : pioglitazone , lanreotide and S-trans-trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid ( FTS ) . pioglitazone (PGZ) is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg), itself a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, responsible for the modulation of a number of metabolic pathways, including cell differentiation, metabolism of lipids and inflammation. lanreotide (LAN) is a somatostatin analogue that has an inhibitory effect on the release of several hormones, such as growth hormone and serotonine. FTS is a specific antagonist of the protoocogene Ras, tested here based on the rationale that Ras is activated in many hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We showed that both PGZ and LAN were efficient in the first, pre-neoplastic model, by reducing the size of FAH, decreasing proliferation specifically in FAH by interacting with proteins of the cell cycle. We could also demonstrate that LAN increased apoptosis. In the second model, LAN was able to diminish the number of established HCC by decreasing proliferation, in parallel with an anti-fibrotic action. Furthermore, enhanced apoptosis and antiangiogenic effects were observed when LAN was given from the start of the carcinogenic induction by DEN. The cellular mechanisms leading to its effects warrant further investigations. FTS also strongly inhibited the appearance of FAH and HCC in the second model, through a complete inhibition of Ras activation and the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways. On the contrary, PGZ did not prevent the appearance of neoplastic lesions. For these reasons, we did not analyse further its mechanism of action in the second model. Altogether, the results we obtained demonstrate an activity of both LAN and FTS, at the early onset of liver carcinogenesis, and later on when advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC are induced. These anti-tumoural effects could be complementary and will be tested in combination in the future.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21563652/"}

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the first-line drugs for use in the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Generic statins could change the cost effectiveness of statin therapies in Spain, and more population groups could be included in the recommendations for reduction of cholesterol levels based on cost effectiveness. ### objectives The objectives of this study were: (i) to assess the cost effectiveness of available statins for the reduction of LDL-C levels in Spain in 2010, after the introduction of generics and reference prices; (ii) to assess the cost effectiveness of combination therapy using a statin plus cholestyramine or ezetimibe; and (iii) to estimate the mean cost per patient to achieve National Cholesterol Education Program (Adult Treatment Panel-III) therapeutic objectives. ### methods The following treatments were evaluated: rosuvastatin 5-20\u2009mg/day; atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin 10-40\u2009mg/day; lovastatin and fluvastatin 20-80\u2009mg/day; and combination therapy with a statin plus either cholestyramine 12-24\u2009g/day or ezetimibe 10\u2009mg/day. The cost effectiveness was evaluated in terms of cost per percentage point reduction in LDL-C, comparing the annual treatment costs with the effectiveness in reducing LDL-C. Treatment costs included those for medications (2010 wholesale prices), control measures, and treatment of adverse drug effects. The effectiveness of statins was estimated by developing a meta-analysis of clinical trials published between 1993 and 2005 that met several inclusion criteria. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to assess the efficiency of individual statin and combination therapies in reducing LDL-C levels. ### results The effectiveness in terms of percentage reduction in LDL-C ranged from 19% for pravastatin 10\u2009mg/day to 55% for atorvastatin 80\u2009mg/day. Annual treatment costs ranged from Euro 189.7 for simvastatin 10\u2009mg/day to Euro 759.3 for atorvastatin 80\u2009mg/day. The cost-effectiveness ratios, in terms of cost per percentage point reduction in LDL-C, were: Euro 6 for simvastatin, Euro 10-12 for rosuvastatin, Euro 10 for lovastatin, Euro 13-16 for atorvastatin, Euro 13-14 for fluvastatin, and Euro 14-20 for pravastatin. Rosuvastatin + ezetimibe , simvastatin + ezetimibe , and atorvastatin + ezetimibe were the most cost-effective combination therapies for reducing LDL-C levels . rosuvastatin was the most cost-effective statin for achieving the LDL-C therapeutic goal in patients at high risk for CHD, with a mean cost per patient of Euro 516. simvastatin was the most cost-effective statin to achieve the LDL-C goal in patients with moderate or low CHD risk, with a cost per patient of Euro 217 and Euro 190, respectively. ### conclusion rosuvastatin should be the first-choice agent in patients with high CHD risk, while simvastatin should be the first choice in patients with moderate or low risk. The addition of ezetimibe to rosuvastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin should be the preferred combination therapies when greater LDL-C reductions are required.

The two nonapeptides arginine vasopressin and oxytocin are not only secreted from the neurohypophysis into the general circulation but are also released intracerebrally. Our recent research has focused on the release patterns and effects of oxytocin and vasopressin in brain areas, such as the septum and hypothalamus, that are thought to be involved in the regulation of (1) behavioural responses and (2) responses of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system (HNS) to stressor exposure in rats. The results demonstrate that combined physical and emotional stress (induced by exposure to forced swimming) selectively triggers the release of vasopressin within all brain areas under study but not into the general circulation. Under emotional stress conditions (induced by exposure to the 'social defeat' procedure), however, oxytocin rather than vasopressin release increased within the hypothalamus and septum. Experiments aimed at revealing the neuroendocrine and behavioural relevance of the local nonapeptide release provided evidence for an involvement of vasopressin in the regulation of HNS activity (within the hypothalamus) and, moreover, in acute stress-coping strategies, anxiety-related behaviour and learning and memory processes (within the septum). The observed dissociation between central and peripheral nonapeptide release not only supports the hypothesis that plasma vasopressin and oxytocin concentrations do not necessarily reflect central release patterns but also suggests vasopressin and oxytocin neurones are able to independently release their nonapeptide from different parts of their neuronal surface (e.g. from somata/dendrites vs. axon terminals). This remarkable regulatory capacity provides the basis for an differential involvement of vasopressin, and probably also oxytocin, in the co-ordination of neuroendocrine activity, emotionality and cognition at different brain levels to ensure an appropriate behavioural response of the organism to stressful stimuli.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10795914/"}

Clinician- and patient-reported toxicities were collected each week during treatment. We fit binomial generalized linear models to maximum toxicity scores across all patients' visits. ### results Of 123 patients with\u00a0\u2265 4 PRO assessments, 87 (71%) patients reported a clinically meaningful PRO score of 3 or higher for diarrhea, and 91 (74%) patients reported a PRO score of\u00a0\u2265 3 for urgency, during 1 or more weeks of treatment, corresponding to 'very frequent' or worse. Of 116 patients who had also completed\u00a0\u2265 4 clinician-reported assessments for descriptive analysis, clinically significant diarrhea (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade\u00a0\u2265 2) was reported in 9% of patients, and grade 2 proctitis and cystitis were reported in 20% and 4%, respectively. Eighty-four (68%) patients had undergone induction chemotherapy prior to CRT. Patients who received induction chemotherapy had 68% lower odds of experiencing significant urgency (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.95; P\u00a0= .04), 76% lower odds of bleeding (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.1-0.62; P\u00a0< .01), and 75% lower odds of tenesmus (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.6; P\u00a0< .01) versus those treated with upfront CRT. ### conclusion Based on PROs, a high proportion of patients experienced clinically significant symptoms during pelvic CRT, with diarrhea and urgency being most commonly reported. This appears to be under-reported on clinician-reported assessments. Delivery of induction chemotherapy was associated with lower odds of experiencing urgency, bleeding, and tenesmus on PROs during subsequent CRT, with no significant impact on diarrhea and rectal pain.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104990/"}

III: Effect of lincomycin and clindamycin combinations on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The functional dependencies of apparent first-order generation rate constants kapp, of drug-affected cultures on drug concentrations indicate that lincomycin and clindamycin possess the same mechanism of action, which is bacteriostatic, against Staphylococcus aureus. clindamycin also possesses another mechanism of action, which is bactericidal, at high concentration levels. However , clindamycin possesses only one of the two mechanisms of lincomycin action , which is bacteriostatic , against Escherichia coli . The relative potency of action of a clindamycin-lincomycin combination against Staph. aureus is variable, and the effective ratio ranges between 5:1 and 9:1; the effective ratio against E. coli is fixed at 6:1 over a wide concentration range. This difference is attributed to differences in bioavailability and/or binding characteristics of the drugs for bioreceptors, as a consequence of structural modifications in the drug molecules, and to differences in modes of action in the respective organisms. Mixtures containing equipotent fractions of clindamycin and lincomycin show \"equivalence\" or \"indifference\" of effects on Staph. aureus. The combined action of the mixtures can be quantitatively predicted from the separate dose-response curves of either component drug alone. Therefore, it is concluded that clindamycin and lincomycin may bind to the same receptor site that is engaged in microbial protein synthesis to inhibit the generation of Staph. aureus. However, combinations of clindamycin and lincomycin are less active than the a priori equipotent concentration of either drug alone in their action against E. coli, demonstrating unequivocally an antagonism of effects. Furthermore, the degree of antagonism is dependent on the order of addition of the drugs, which is attributed to the possibility that clindamycin and lincomycin bind differently on active and allosteric loci of the same receptor site functionally engaged in protein synthesis in E. coli. A rational approach to the quantification and prediction of combined antibiotic action must, therefore, be based not only on the kinetics and mechanisms of action as well as on the dose-response relationship over a wide concentration range for the separate antibiotics but also on the strain and species of the test organism.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1102659/"}

Among the 344 isolates analysed, 18 different CoNS species were identified and S. sciuri represented the most prevalent species (46%). High resistance rates were detected for tetracycline (71%), penicillin (65%) and oxacillin (64%) as well as fusidic acid (50%), which was mainly due to reduced susceptibility among S. sciuri isolates. S. sciuri exhibited pronounced multiresistance , and many isolates were characterised by the carriage of a number of uncommon (multi)resistance genes ( e.g. cfr , apmA , fexA ) and decreased susceptibility towards last resort antibiotics such as linezolid and daptomycin . The combined data suggest that S. sciuri harbours a significant resistance gene pool that requires further attention. We hypothesise that members of this species, due to their flexible lifestyle, might contribute to the spread of such genes in livestock environments.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27185355/"}

However, combining both anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR antibodies with chemotherapy in first-line treatment resulted in adverse outcomes. We assessed whether the combination of erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with bevacizumab could increase the efficacy of maintenance therapy in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. ### methods This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was undertaken in 49 centres in France, Austria, and Canada. Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years with histologically confirmed, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, WHO performance status 0-2, had received no previous therapy for metastatic disease, and had adequate organ function. Patients without disease progression after bevacizumab-based induction therapy were randomly assigned (1:1) by a minimisation technique to bevacizumab (7\u00b75 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or bevacizumab plus erlotinib (150 mg once daily) as maintenance therapy until progression. All patients were stratified by centre, baseline performance status, age, and number of metastatic sites.

Median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range: 38-80 years). The most common site of metastasis was lungs (n = 24) followed by bone (n = 19) and liver (n = 7). Three patients had favorable risk disease, whereas 25 had intermediate risk and 12 had poor risk disease according to the MSKCC risk criteria. First-line TKI therapy used was sunitinib in 24, pazopanib in 11, and sorafenib in 5 patients. Toxicities of TKIs were Grade 1 or 2 in 13 patients and Grade 3 or 4 in 9 patients; the most common being fatigue, followed by hand-foot syndrome, skin rash, mucositis, and hypertension. Overall, 29 patients (72.5%) had disease control (complete responses in 1, partial responses in 10, and stable disease in 18 patients), whereas 11 had progression of disease at initial evaluation. At a median follow-up of 16 months (range: 2-38 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.8 months and median overall survival was 19.1 months. ### conclusions sunitinib and pazopanib are viable first-line options for mRCC and showed a comparable PFS in Indian patients. Careful patient selection, tailoring of TKI doses, and careful toxicity management are essential for optimum therapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30082547/"}

The use of artemisinin derivative-based combination therapy (ACT) such as artesunate plus amodiaquine is currently recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Fixed-dose combinations are more adapted to patients than regimens involving multiple tablets and improve treatment compliance. A fixed-dose combination of artesunate + amodiaquine ( ASAQ ) was recently developed . To assess the efficacy and safety of this new combination and to define its optimum dosage regimen (once or twice daily) in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, a multicentre clinical study was conducted. ### methods A multicentre, randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, parallel-group study was conducted in five African centers in Cameroon, Madagascar, Mali and Senegal from March to December 2006. Efficacy and safety of ASAQ were assessed compared to those of artemether + lumefantrine (AL). The WHO protocol with a 28-day follow-up for assessing the drug therapeutic efficacy was used. Patients suffering from uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were randomized to receive ASAQ orally once daily (ASAQ1), ASAQ twice daily (ASAQ2) or AL twice daily (AL) for three days. The primary outcome was PCR-corrected parasitological cure rate and clinical response. ### results Of 941 patients initially randomized and stratified into two age groups (<5 years, and >or=5 years), 936 (99.5%) were retained for the intent to treat (ITT) analysis, and 859 (91.3%) patients for the per protocol (PP) analysis. Among ITT population, up to D28, PCR-corrected adequate parasitological and clinical response rates were 95.2% in the ASAQ1 group, 94.9% in the ASAQ2 group and 95.5% in the AL group. Moreover, the cure rate evaluated among PP population was >or=98.5% in both ASAQ therapeutic arms. Therapeutic response rates did not display any significant differences between age groups or between one geographical site and another. Altogether, this demonstrates the non-inferiority of ASAQ1 regimen compared to both ASAQ2 and AL regimens. During follow-up mild and moderate adverse events including gastrointestinal and/or nervous disorders were reported in 29.3% of patients, with no difference between groups in the nature, frequency or intensity of adverse events. ### conclusion The non-inferiority of ASAQ compared with AL was demonstrated. The fixed-dose combination artesunate + amodiaquine (ASAQ) is safe and efficacious even in young children under 5 years of age. Whilst administration on a twice-a-day basis does not improve the efficacy of ASAQ significantly, a once-a-day intake of this new combination clearly appears as an effective and safe therapy in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria both in adults and children. Implications of such findings are of primary importance in terms of public health especially in African countries. As most national policies plan to strengthen malaria control to reach the elimination of this disease, anti-malarial drugs such as the artesunate + amodiaquine fixed-dose ACT will play a pivotal role in this process. ### Trial Registration The protocol was registered with the www.clinicaltrials.gov open clinical trial registry under the identifier number NCT00316329.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19505304/"}

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a hematological malignancy with unfavorable prognosis. Novel therapeutic approaches for treating the disease are aimed at the mechanisms regulating growth signals, cellular proliferation, and survival pathways of the malignant clones. bortezomib (Brt), a proteasome inhibitor with pleiotropic activities was shown to be active in MCL and is currently implemented in therapeutic combinations for this disease. Telomerase activity is essential for survival of malignant cells and as such is considered a valid therapeutic target. This study evaluated the effects of bortezomib on telomerase activity and its regulation in MCL cells in vitro and ex vivo. Our study shows that bortezomib exerts a cytotoxic effect in a dose dependent manner in two MCL cell lines, with differential sensitivity. While the IC50 for HBL-2 cells ranged between 2.5 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml during 24-72 h respectively, the IC50 for the NCEB cells was twice. bortezomib differentially inhibited telomerase activity (TA): in HBL-2 cells there was a decline of 20%-55% during 24-72 h respectively. However in NCEB cells the decline was much smaller, and did not exceed 25%. Inhibition of telomerase activity is shown to be operated by two separate mechanisms: reduction of the hTERT mRNA expression (controlled by the binding of transcription factors) and reduction in phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of hTERT by its kinases, AKT and PKC\u03b1. A decrease in telomerase activity was demonstrated also in mononuclear cells, isolated from three MCL patients following incubation of the cells in the presence of bortezomib for 24-72 h. In one patient the decrease in TA ranged between 17%-37% respectively, in the second patient between 63%-76% and in the third patient between 70-100% for 24-72 h respectively. The current study indicates that a combination of bortezomib and rapamycin, (an m-Tor pathway inhibitor used in MCL treatment) induced synergistic inhibition of telomerase activity. In HBL-2 cells, the combined treatment of bortezomib and rapamycin decreased TA by 80% compared to the expected value (40%) and for NCEB cells a similar trend was observed. In contrast, there was neither additive nor synergistic effect of this combination on cell proliferation. In the light of the crucial role of telomerase in cancer cells, it was important to characterize the possible relations between telomerase and bortezomib and to distinguish the biochemical mechanisms of its regulation and its interactions with other signal transduction inhibitors such as rapamycin.

We evaluated whether the benefit of chemotherapy correlates with its effects on distant or pelvic relapse. ### Materials And Methods We retrospectively evaluated the records of all 107 patients who underwent cystectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer at our institution between 1988 and 1994. Factors predicting relapse were identified and used to group patients at high or low risk. The outcome in each group with and without M-VAC chemotherapy was then analyzed in terms of overall, metastatic and pelvic relapse. Univariate analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank statistic, and multivariate analysis was done using the Cox proportional hazards model. Median survival was 29 months for patients free of disease. ### results Pathological stage T3 or greater according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer, tumor greater than 3 cm. and creatinine greater than 1.5-fold normal were independent poor prognostic factors in patients treated with cystectomy only. Patients with any of these factors or metastatic involvement of the pelvic lymph nodes were considered at high risk. All 35 low risk patients were treated with cystectomy only and had an excellent outcome with a 3-year relapse-free survival plus or minus standard error of 93% +/- 5%. The 3-year rates in 52 and 20 high risk patients treated without and with chemotherapy, respectively, were 42% +/- 8% versus 57% +/- 13% for relapse-free survival (p = 0.17), 38% +/- 9% versus 8% +/- 8% for pelvic failure (p = 0.02) and 39% +/- 9% versus 38% +/- 13% for distant metastases (not significant). Multivariate analysis of patients who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy revealed that perioperative chemotherapy improved relapse-free survival and pelvic control but not metastatic control (p = 0.03, 0.02 and 0.31, respectively). ### conclusions Low risk patients have excellent disease control when treated with cystectomy only. Those with high risk features are at substantial risk for pelvic failure (38% at 3 years) after cystectomy only. Perioperative M-VAC chemotherapy has a profound impact on pelvic but not on metastatic failure.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10751847/"}

To estimate the impact of therapy on hip fractures, costs, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), the analysis included women>or=65 years, treated with risedronate or alendronate and followed for 4 additional years. Country-specific data included population mortality, fracture costs, and annual drug costs, using a German social insurance perspective. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. A differential hip fracture relative risk reduction of 43% was applied to risedronate vs. alendronate. ### results The model predicted that treatment with risedronate would result in fewer hip fractures and more QALYs at a reduced cost (savings of euro278 per treated woman) compared to treatment with generic alendronate. Sensitivity analysis assuming 2 years of treatment and equivalence of effect after 1 year show cost savings as well (euro106 per treated woman). ### discussion Whereas previous economic evaluations involving bisphosphonates have mainly relied on efficacy data from noncomparative clinical trials, this study's strength is in the use of comparative effectiveness data from one data source. The magnitude of the cost savings observed were sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding treatment duration, therapy discontinuation and cost of generic alendronate. ### conclusions Based on \"real world\" data the analysis supports the first line use of risedronate for the treatment of osteoporotic women in Germany.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883401/"}

Preoperative infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and concurrent radiation therapy (RT) followed by total mesorectal surgery is the current standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer (LAR). When compared with postoperative 5-FU-based chemoradiation, this strategy is associated with significantly lower rates of local relapse, lower toxicity and better compliance. capecitabine is a rationally designed oral prodrug that is converted into 5-FU by intracellular thymidine phosphorylase. Substitution of infusional 5-FU with capecitabine is an attractive option that provides a more convenient administration schedule and, possibly, increased efficacy. Indeed, incorporation of capecitabine in combined modality neoadjuvant therapy for LAR has been under intense investigation during the last 10 years. Phase I and II clinical trials showed that a regimen consisting of capecitabine 825mg/m(2) twice daily for 7 days/week continuous oral administration in combination with RT is an active and well tolerated regimen, thereby being the preferred concurrent regimen. The definitive demonstration that efficacy of capecitabine/RT is similar to 5-FU/RT has been provided by the NSABP-R-04 and the German Margit trials. One approach to improve outcomes in rectal cancer is to deliver a second RT-sensitizing drug with effective systemic activity. oxaliplatin and irinotecan are therefore good candidates. However , two phase III trials demonstrated that incorporation of oxaliplatin to capecitabine with RT did not improve early outcomes and , by contrast , increased toxicity . capecitabine has also been combined with irinotecan. This regimen showed encouraging results in phase I and II clinical trials, which led to an ongoing phase III clinical trial. New strategies with induction chemotherapy with or without chemoradiation prior to surgery are currently under investigation. Whether or not capecitabine has a role in this setting is being investigated in ongoing trials. Incorporation of agents directed towards new targets, such as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies or antiangiogenic agents, in combination preoperative regimens, is being hampered by results of early trials in which efficacy outcomes with cetuximab were poor and an excessive rate of surgical complications with bevacizumab was observed. The lack of improvements in efficacy with the addition of cetuximab or bevacizumab in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer led to concerns about further development of these agents in rectal cancer. The role of capecitabine in the postoperative adjuvant setting is the aim of the ongoing Dutch SCRIPT trial. The prediction of response associated with capecitabine has been based on expression of thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, as well as on gene expression arrays. All these procedures require further validation and should be considered as investigational. In conclusion, capecitabine can safely and effectively replace intravenous continuous infusion of 5-FU in the preoperative chemoradiation setting for rectal cancer management. The addition of other new antineoplastic agents to a fluoropyrimidine-based regimen remains investigational.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22621694/"}

Nevertheless, the adoption of lipid rescue therapy by Chinese practitioners remains unknown. We, therefore, evaluated the current approaches to treat LAST and the use of lipid rescue therapy among anesthesiologists in China. ### methods In September 2013, a 23-question survey on regional anesthesia practice and availability of lipid emulsions was sent by e-mail to directors or designated individuals at 41 academic anesthesiology departments listed by the orthopedic anesthesia group of the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology. ### results Responses were received from 36 of the 41 (88 %) anesthesiology departments. To simplify the analysis, responses were divided into two groups according to the annual percentage of patients who received regional anesthesia (RA) for orthopedic anesthesia: 14 departments (39%) with high-utilization (\u2265 50%) and 22 departments (61%) low-utilization (<50%) of RA. Ropivacaine and bupivacaine were the common drugs used for RA , which were independent of RA utilization . Interestingly, ultrasound-guided techniques were much more frequently used in low-utilization institutions than in high-utilization institutions (P = 0.025). Lipid emulsion was readily available in 8 of the 36 (22%) responding institutions, with 7 of the other 28 (25%) institutions planning to stock lipid emulsion. No differences in lipid availability and storage plans were observed between high- and low-utilization institutions. Lipid resuscitation was performed in five of the eight departments that had lipid emulsion. Eleven patients were successfully resuscitated and one was not. ### conclusion Lipid emulsion is not widely available in China to treat LAST resulted from RA for orthopedic patients.

Furthermore, in primary AML samples (IDH2R140Q or R172K), combination treatment reduced CD34+ cells and increased CD15+ cells to a greater extent than attained with single agents. To explore the mechanism of enhanced differentiation with combination treatment, the TF-1 epigenome was analyzed by profiling 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) DNA methylation changes. enasidenib treatment alone increased 5hmC, consistent with reactivation of ten-eleven-translocation (TET) enzyme activity. Compared with treatment with azacitidine alone, combination treatment reduced 5mC levels at greater numbers of sites and these loci were significantly enriched in regions with increased 5hMC (25.8% vs. 7.4%). Results are consistent with a model in which enasidenib-mediated reactivation of ten-eleven-translocation enzymes cooperates with azacitidine-mediated inhibition of DNA methyltransferase enzymes, leading to greater reductions in DNA methylation and enhanced erythroid differentiation.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33794295/"}

The combination of steroid and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) intravitreal therapeutic agents could potentially have synergistic effects for treating diabetic macular oedema (DMO). On the one hand, if combined treatment is more effective than monotherapy, there would be significant implications for improving patient outcomes. Conversely, if there is no added benefit of combination therapy, then people could be potentially exposed to unnecessary local or systemic side effects. ### objectives To assess the effects of intravitreal agents that block vascular endothelial growth factor activity (anti-VEGF agents) plus intravitreal steroids versus monotherapy with macular laser, intravitreal steroids or intravitreal anti-VEGF agents for managing DMO. ### Search Methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2018, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; LILACS; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP. The date of the search was 21 February 2018. ### Selection Criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of intravitreal anti-VEGF combined with intravitreal steroids versus intravitreal anti-VEGF alone, intravitreal steroids alone or macular laser alone for managing DMO. We included people with DMO of all ages and both sexes. We also included trials where both eyes from one participant received different treatments. ### Data Collection And Analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.Two authors independently reviewed all the titles and abstracts identified from the electronic and manual searches against the inclusion criteria. Our primary outcome was change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between baseline and one year. Secondary outcomes included change in central macular thickness (CMT), economic data and quality of life. We considered adverse effects including intraocular inflammation, raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and development of cataract. ### Main Results There were eight RCTs (703 participants, 817 eyes) that met our inclusion criteria with only three studies reporting outcomes at one year. The studies took place in Iran (3), USA (2), Brazil (1), Czech Republic (1) and South Korea (1). Seven studies used the unlicensed anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab and one study used licensed ranibizumab. The study that used licensed ranibizumab had a unique design compared with the other studies in that included eyes had persisting DMO after anti-VEGF monotherapy and received three monthly doses of ranibizumab prior to allocation. The anti-VEGF agent was combined with intravitreal triamcinolone in six studies and with an intravitreal dexamethasone implant in two studies. The comparator group was anti-VEGF alone in all studies; two studies had an additional steroid monotherapy arm, another study had an additional macular laser photocoagulation arm. Whilst we judged these studies to be at low risk of bias for most domains, at least one domain was at unclear risk in all studies.When comparing anti-VEGF/steroid with anti-VEGF monotherapy as primary therapy for DMO, we found no meaningful clinical difference in change in BCVA (mean difference (MD) -2.29 visual acuity (VA) letters, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.03 to 1.45; 3 RCTs; 188 eyes; low-certainty evidence) or change in CMT (MD 0.20 \u03bcm, 95% CI -37.14 to 37.53; 3 RCTs; 188 eyes; low-certainty evidence) at one year. There was very low-certainty evidence on intraocular inflammation from 8 studies, with one event in the anti-VEGF/steroid group (313 eyes) and two events in the anti-VEGF group (322 eyes). There was a greater risk of raised IOP (Peto odds ratio (OR) 8.13, 95% CI 4.67 to 14.16; 635 eyes; 8 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) and development of cataract (Peto OR 7.49, 95% CI 2.87 to 19.60; 635 eyes; 8 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) in eyes receiving anti-VEGF/steroid compared with anti-VEGF monotherapy. There was low-certainty evidence from one study of an increased risk of systemic adverse events in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the anti-VEGF alone group (Peto OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.86; 103 eyes).One study compared anti-VEGF/steroid versus macular laser therapy. At one year investigators did not report a meaningful difference between the groups in change in BCVA (MD 4.00 VA letters 95% CI -2.70 to 10.70; 80 eyes; low-certainty evidence) or change in CMT (MD -16.00 \u03bcm, 95% CI -68.93 to 36.93; 80 eyes; low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence suggesting an increased risk of cataract in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the macular laser group (Peto OR 4.58, 95% 0.99 to 21.10, 100 eyes) and an increased risk of elevated IOP in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the macular laser group (Peto OR 9.49, 95% CI 2.86 to 31.51; 100 eyes).One study provided very low-certainty evidence comparing anti-VEGF/steroid versus steroid monotherapy at one year. There was no evidence of a meaningful difference in BCVA between treatments at one year (MD 0 VA letters, 95% CI -6.1 to 6.1, low-certainty evidence). Likewise, there was no meaningful difference in the mean CMT at one year (MD - 9 \u03bcm, 95% CI -39.87\u03bcm to 21.87\u03bcm between the anti-VEGF/steroid group and the steroid group. There was very low-certainty evidence on raised IOP at one year comparing the anti-VEGF/steroid versus steroid groups (Peto OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.55).No included study reported impact of treatment on patients' quality of life or economic data. None of the studies reported any cases of endophthalmitis. ### Authors Conclusions Combination of intravitreal anti-VEGF plus intravitreal steroids does not appear to offer additional visual benefit compared with monotherapy for DMO; at present the evidence for this is of low-certainty. There was an increased rate of cataract development and raised intraocular pressure in eyes treated with anti-VEGF plus steroid versus anti-VEGF alone. Patients were exposed to potential side effects of both these agents without reported additional benefit. The majority of the evidence comes from studies of bevacizumab and triamcinolone used as primary therapy for DMO . There is limited evidence from studies using licensed intravitreal anti-VEGF agents plus licensed intravitreal steroid implants with at least one year follow-up. It is not known whether treatment response is different in eyes that are phakic and pseudophakic at baseline.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29669176/"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were eligible. Sequential and concurrent schedules were studied.  RESULTS: Forty-three patients were studied in 9 different dose levels (6 sequential and 3 concurrent). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on the sequential schedule was decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and vorinostat 200 mg three times a day on days 6-12.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is damaging the world's social and economic fabrics seriously. Effective drugs are urgently needed to decrease the high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, effective antiviral drugs or vaccines are currently unavailable. Herein, we systematically evaluated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on gene expression of both lung tissue and blood from COVID-19 patients using transcriptome profiling. Differential gene expression analysis revealed potential core mechanism of COVID-19-induced pneumonia in which IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF and IL6 triggered cytokine storm mediated by neutrophil, macrophage, B and DC cells. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified two gene modules that are highly correlated with clinical traits of COVID-19 patients, and confirmed that over-activation of immune system-mediated cytokine release syndrome is the underlying pathogenic mechanism for acute phase of COVID-19 infection. It suggested that anti-inflammatory therapies may be promising regimens for COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, drug repurposing analysis of thousands of drugs revealed that TNF\u03b1 inhibitor etanercept and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-B receptor (GABABR) agonist baclofen showed most significant reversal power to COVID-19 gene signature, so we are highly optimistic about their clinical use for COVID-19 treatment.

In this study, we assessed the cytotoxic interaction between docetaxel and doxorubicin administered at various schedules to human breast and ovarian cancer cells. Through a series of in vitro assays including DNA fragmentation analyses, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, and flow cytometric analyses, we found that the antagonistic interaction occurred when tumor cells were exposed to the two drugs simultaneously or exposed to doxorubicin before docetaxel.

To determine if fluorouracil (5-FU) plus high-dose leucovorin (LV) enhances local response in patients receiving preoperative radiation therapy (RT) for adenocarcinoma of the rectum, we compared the degree of downstaging in patients receiving preoperative RT with or without chemotherapy. ### Patients And Methods For this comparison, three groups of patients who were treated with identical doses and techniques of preoperative pelvic RT (total dose of 5,040 cGy) were examined. Group 1 included 20 patients with unresectable disease who received combined RT and LV/5-FU. Group 2 included 11 patients with unresectable disease who received preoperative RT. Group 3 included 21 patients with invasive, resectable, primary disease who received preoperative RT. ### results Patients with unresectable disease who received LV/5-FU had a higher rate of pathologic complete response (20% v 0%) and a lower incidence of positive nodes (30% v 64%) compared with those who did not receive chemotherapy. Even when the most favorable group of patients was included (group 3), patients who received LV/5-FU still had a higher complete response rate (20% v 6%) and a lower incidence of positive nodes (30% v 53%) compared with those who received RT without LV/5-FU. Of those patients with initially unresectable disease, the resectability rate was higher in those who received LV/5-FU compared with those who did not receive LV/5-FU (90% v 64%). Patients who received LV/5-FU experienced slightly more grade 1 to 2 fatigue, stomatitis, nausea, and grade 3 diarrhea, tenesmus, and dysuria. ### conclusions Despite the fact that patients who received chemotherapy (group 1) had more advanced disease compared with those with resectable disease (group 3), the addition of LV/5-FU increased the resectability and downstaging rates. The ultimate impact of a complete response as well as a decrease in the incidence of pelvic nodes on local control and survival remains to be determined. However, given the enhancement of down-staging in patients with unresectable rectal cancer, we are encouraged by the combined modality approach.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1727928/"}

To analyse the cost-effectiveness of traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) compared to biological therapies from the perspective of Chinese society. ### Methodology Principal Findings A mathematical model was developed by incorporating the clinical trial data and Chinese unit costs and treatment sequences from a lifetime perspective. Hypothetical cohorts with moderate to severe RA were simulated. The primary outcome measure-quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)-was derived from disease severity (HAQ scores). Primary analysis included drug costs, monitoring costs, and other costs. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Treatment sequences that included TNF antagonists and rituximab produced a greater number of QALYs than tDMARDs alone or TNF antagonists plus DMARDs. In comparison with tDMARDs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab without rituximab were $77,357.7, $26,562.4 and $57,838.4 per QALY and $66,422.9, $28,780.6 and $50,937.6 per QALY, for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab with rituximab. No biotherapy was cost-effective under the willingness to pay threshold when the threshold was 3 times the per capita GDP of China. When 3 times the per capita GDP of Shanghai used as the threshold, infliximab and rituximab could yield nearly 90% cost-effective simulations in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. ### Conclusions Significance tDMARD was the most cost-effective option in the Chinese healthcare setting.

In vitro studies reported here showed verapamil sensitization of Adriamycin resistance in 18.8% of fresh human breast cancer specimens tested. Patients (27) were first treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin and dexamethasone (CVAD) alone. Verapamil and quinine were added in patients with tumors failing to respond or progressing on CVAD alone . Following treatment with CVAD alone there were no complete remissions and 3 patients (11%) developed partial remissions lasting 5.5, 8, 10.5 months.

We compared the responses of the stress hormones, cortisol, ACTH, vasopressin (AVP), corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and catecholamines to elective conventional and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ### design A right upper quadrant transverse incision was used for conventional cholecystectomy, and four 1-2-cm incisions for the laparoscopic procedure (for insertion of surgical instruments, diathermy, fibreoptic telescope and light source, and carbon dioxide insufflation). Blood was sampled immediately prior to premedication ( temazepam ) , after induction of anaesthesia ( fentanyl and thiopentone ) and at 10-minute intervals until the end of the procedure ( N2O maintenance , vecuronium relaxation ) . A blood sample was taken after reversal, and then at 10-minute intervals for 50 minutes. Plasma sodium and blood pressure were measured at similar intervals. Results are expressed as mean +/- standard error. ### patients Twelve patients were studied (six in each group). ### measurements Peptide hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay, cortisol by ELISA and catecholamines by HPLC. ### results The mean premedication hormone values for the conventional and laparoscopic procedures did not increase significantly after induction of anaesthesia. Within 10 minutes of the first incision, however, there was a marked concordant rise in mean plasma ACTH and AVP levels for both procedures (conventional: ACTH, from a premedication value of 10.2 +/- 1.7 to 80.1 +/- 14.3 pmol/l, AVP from 1.2 +/- 0.4 to 117 +/- 24 pmol/l, P < 0.01 for both hormones; laparoscopic: ACTH from 5.8 +/- 2.6 to 55.1 +/- 26.0 pmol/l, AVP from 1.6 +/- 0.11 to 49.2 +/- 27.09 pmol/l). At the end of both types of operation mean levels of ACTH and AVP were still elevated, although the ACTH: AVP ratio had increased. Greater variability in ACTH and AVP responses was seen in the laparoscopic than in the conventional procedure, three patients showing a relatively small response to surgery. Total secretion of ACTH during both types of surgery was not significantly less both during (P < 0.05), and after (P < 0.01) laparoscopic surgery. For both procedures, the timing of AVP and ACTH peaks was significantly related (P < 0.002). A small but significant rise in CRH was observed 30 minutes after the start of surgery for both procedures P < 0.05). The timing of CRH and ACTH peaks was unrelated. The maximum mean plasma cortisol level for the conventional procedure (1268 +/- 147 nmol/l) was reached 20 minutes after reversal of anaesthesia and remained at this level until the end of sampling. The cortisol response was comparable during the laparoscopic procedure but was beginning to fall at 60 minutes post-operatively. Plasma adrenaline responses to the two types of surgery were not significantly different, but the plasma total noradrenaline response to laparoscopic surgery as indicated by the response area during the first 20 minutes was significantly increased (P < 0.02). Plasma sodium, renin activity and initial systolic blood pressure fall were not significantly different during the two procedures. ### conclusions For both procedures, the peak of ACTH secretion after incision is likely to be AVP dependent, and the timing of peak levels of these two hormones was significantly related. Subsequent ACTH secretion may be the result of an interaction between AVP and CRH. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in a smaller AVP rise than does the conventional procedure, and plasma AVP falls more rapidly post-operatively. During the period of observation, ACTH, CRH, cortisol and adrenaline responses were not significantly lessened by the laparoscopic approach, but there was a significant increase in the noradrenaline response.

A mouse model was used to investigate which antibiotics negatively influenced the donor flora and reduced the colonization resistance when administered intraperitoneally. Erythromycin , clindamycin and carbenicillin suppressed the donor flora permanently , as could be seen by the reduced colonization resistance . benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, doxycycline and the combination gentamicin-cephalothin affected the colonization resistance as long as these agents were present. gentamicin alone and cephalothin and oxytetracycline had no effect on the colonization resistance.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6795128/"}

Mannose-derived conjugates were prepared in two steps, in good yields, by condensing an acid derivative of a protected mannose with the PIs, followed by deprotection of the sugar protecting group. With respect to hydrolysis, these PI prodrugs are chemically stable with half-life times in the 50-60 h range that are compatible with an in vivo utilization aimed at improving the absorption/penetration or accumulation of the prodrug in specific cells/tissues and liberation of the active free drug inside HIV-infected cells. These stabilities correlate closely with the low in vitro anti-HIV activity measured for those prodrugs wherein the coupling of mannose to the PIs was performed through the peptidomimetic PI's hydroxyl. Importantly, mannose conjugation to the PIs was further found to improve the absorptive transepithelial transport of saquinavir and indinavir but not of nelfinavir across Caco-2 cell monolayers, by contrast to glucose conjugation which had the opposite effect.

Therefore, nanotechnology gained special attention as it has potential to improve patient compliance, bioavailability and reduction in dosing frequency. ### objective The aim of this study is to fabricate alginate-chitosan nanoparticles (AL-CS NPs) under appropriate conditions using ionic gelation method. The use of natural polymers in nanoparticle fabrication has a vast application due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility and nontoxic nature. Ionic gelation method involves the interaction between macromolecules with opposite charged ionizable groups forming polyelectrolyte complex. Hence, it is rational to formulate natural polymerbased sustained release nano-particulate matrix to improve patient adherence, reducing dose frequency and drug toxicity. ### method The formulations were based on 32 factorial designs. Nanoparticles of combined drug (isoniazid- INH and pyrazinamide-PYZ) were fabricated using natural polymer. Formulation process involved the use of pregelated sodium alginate followed by ionic gelation with chitosan. Pregelation of sodium alginate included calcium chloride.

One possible mechanism by which this might occur would be for topiramate to increase plasma methamphetamine level. Such an effect also would be expected to enhance methamphetamine-induced hemodynamic response. We, therefore, studied -- in the same experiment from which the previous findings originated -- the effects of topiramate on the kinetic profile and hemodynamic response to methamphetamine.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy as the over-expressed MDR protein acts as an efflux pump, which leads to a reduction in the uptake of the anticancer agent by tumour cells. We combined topotecan and amlodipine together into the stealthy liposomes, in which amlodipine was applied as a MDR reversing agent to overcome the resistance. ### Materials And Methods Cytotoxicity, apoptosis and the signalling pathway assays were performed on human chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562, promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 and MDR HL-60 cells, respectively. Pharmacokinetics and antitumour activity studies were performed on normal Kunming mice and female BALB/c nude mice with MDR HL-60 xenografts, respectively. ### results topotecan alone was effective in inhibiting the growth of non-resistant leukaemia cells, K562 and HL-60 cells but not the growth of MDR HL-60 cells. The resistance of topotecan in MDR HL-60 cells was potently reversed by the addition of amlodipine . Moreover, amlodipine enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect of topotecan synergistically. Apoptosis was through activating caspases in a cascade: first, the initiator caspase 8 and then effectors caspase 3/7 (total activity of caspases 3 and 7) were activated. Being encapsulated into the stealthy liposomes with an acidic internal medium, topotecan existed dominantly in an active lactone species, which was reversibly changed from an inactive carboxylate form via a pH-dependent reaction. After administration of stealthy liposomes to mice, the blood exposure of the lactone form was evidently increased and extended.

However, clinical use of the terfenadine has been associated with rare but severe cardiac arrhythmias, in particular torsades de pointes. ### objective To establish a quantitative experimental model for assessing the sedating and cardiotoxicity potential of non-sedating and sedating antihistamines. ### methods Drugs were administered intravenously and the integrated amplitude of the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) signal was recorded. The threshold dose that depressed EEG activity was compared with the dose required to inhibit by 50% the peripheral bronchospasm elicited by 10 micrograms/kg i.v., of histamine. In separate studies , the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and cardiovascular effects of loratadine ( 30 and 100 mg/kg , i.v . ) , terfenadine ( 10 mg/kg , i.v . ) , promethazine ( 5 mg/kg , i.v . ) and diphenhydramine ( 20 mg/kg , i.v . ) were evaluated . ### results The sedating antihistamines, diphenhydramine and promethazine, depressed the integrated EEG at doses between 0.6 and 2.0 times their peripheral antihistamine doses. loratadine had no EEG depressant activity at 100 mg/kg, i.v., a dose more than 170 times its ED50 (0.58 mg/kg, i.v.) against histamine bronchospasm. We were unable to evaluate the EEG effects of terfenadine, because it produced cardiovascular collapse at 10 mg/kg, i.v. loratadine and promethazine did not produce adverse cardiovascular effects, nor did they alter normal ECG activity. diphenhydramine produced bradycardia followed by a transient hypertensive phase without affecting the QTc interval. In contrast, terfenadine elicited hypotension, bradycardia and significant arrhythmogenic activity, causing a prolongation of the QTc interval and a torsades de pointes--like ventricular arrhythmia. Pharmacokinetic studies after i.v. administration of loratadine (30 and 100 mg/kg) demonstrated plasma levels of loratadine and its major metabolite descarboethoxyloratadine to be several orders of magnitude greater than levels found in humans at the clinical dose of 10 mg. ### conclusion The CNS depressant effects of H1 antihistamines are promethazine approximately diphenhydramine >> loratadine = placebo. Of the non-sedating antihistamines, loratadine was devoid of adverse cardiovascular effects whereas terfenadine caused a pronounced disruption of the normal ECG, characterized by a torsades de pointes-like effect.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8556569/"}

First line chemotherapeutics for brain tumors (malignant gliomas) are alkylating agents such as temozolomide and nimustine. Despite growing knowledge of how these agents work, patients suffering from this malignancy still face a dismal prognosis. Alkylating agents target DNA, forming the killing lesion O(6)-alkylguanine, which is converted into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that trigger apoptosis. Here we assessed whether inhibiting repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a reasonable strategy for sensitizing glioma cells to alkylating agents. For down-regulation of HR in glioma cells, we used an interference RNA (iRNA) approach targeting Rad51 and BRCA2, and for NHEJ we employed the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026. We also assessed whether inhibition of poly(ADP)ribosyltransferase (PARP) by olaparib would enhance the killing effect. The data show that knockdown of Rad51 or BRCA2 greatly sensitizes cells to DSBs and the induction of cell death following temozolomide and nimustine ( ACNU ) . It did not sensitize to ionizing radiation (IR). The expression of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) abolished all these effects, indicating that O(6)-alkylguanine induced by these drugs is the primary lesion responsible for the formation of DSBs and increased sensitivity of glioma cells following knockdown of Rad51 and BRCA2. Inhibition of DNA-PK only slightly sensitized to temozolomide whereas a significant effect was observed with IR. A triple strategy including siRNA and the PARP inhibitor olaparib further improved the killing effect of temozolomide.

During recent years, more intensified systemic and local treatment regimens have increased the 5-year survival figures in localized Ewing's sarcoma to more than 60%. There is, however, concern about the risk of second malignancies (SM) in long-term survivors. We have analyzed the second malignancies in patients treated in the German Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. ### Materials And Methods From January 1981 through June 1991, 674 patients were registered in the two sequential multicentric Ewing's sarcoma trials CESS 81 (recruitment period 1981-1985) and CESS 86 (1986-1991). The systemic treatment in both studies consisted of a four-drug-regimen ( VACA = vincristine , actinomycin D , cyclophosphamide , and adriamycin ; or VAIA = vincristine , actinomycin D , ifosfamide , and adriamycin ) and a total number of four courses , each lasting nine weeks , was recommended by the protocol . Local therapy in curative patients was either complete surgery (n = 162), surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with 36-46Gy (n = 274), or definitive radiotherapy with 46-60Gy (n = 212). The median follow-up at the time of this analysis was 5.1 years, the maximum follow-up 16.5 years. ### results The overall survival of all patients including metastatic patients was 55% after 5 years, 48% after 10 years, and 37% after 15 years. Eight out of 674 patients (1.2%) developed a SM. Five of these were acute myelogenic leukemias (n = 4) or MDS (n = 1), and three were sarcomas. The interval between diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma and the diagnosis of the SM was 17-78 months for the four AMLs, 96 months for the MDS and 82-136 months for the three sarcomas. The cumulative risk of an SM was 0.7% after 5 years, 2.9% after 10 years, and 4.7% after 15 years. Out of five patients with AML/MDS, three died of rapid AML-progression, and two are living with disease. Local therapy (surgery vs. surgery plus postoperative irradiation vs. definitive radiotherapy) had no impact on the frequency of AML/MDS, but local therapy did influence the risk of secondary sarcomas. All three patients with secondary sarcomas had received radiotherapy; however, all three sarcomas were salvaged by subsequent treatment and are in clinical remission with a follow-up of 1 month, 4.3 years, and 7.5 years after the diagnosis of the secondary sarcoma. Thus far, SM contributed to less than 1 % (3/328) of all deaths in the CESS-studies. ### conclusions The risk of leukemia after treatment for Ewing's sarcoma is probably in the range of 2%. The risk of solid tumors also seems to be low within the first 10 years after treatment and remains in the range of 5 % after 15 years. In the CESS-studies, less than 1% of all deaths within the first 10 years after diagnosis were caused by SM. Effective salvage therapy for secondary sarcomas is feasible.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9788419/"}

Different antidepressant drugs are currently used for the treatment of depression in cancer patients, such as second-generation antidepressants and, recently, the extracts of Hypericum perforatum.

The aim of the present article is to provide an updated review of clinically relevant metabolic drug interactions between selected anticancer drugs and antidepressants, focusing on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and Hypericum extract. SSRIs can cause pharmacokinetic interactions through their in vitro ability to inhibit one or more cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs). SSRIs differ in their potential for metabolic drug interactions with anticancer drugs. Fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 and administration of these SSRIs reduces the clinical benefit of an anticancer drug , such as tamoxifen , by decreasing the formation of active metabolites of this drug . Women with breast cancer who receive paroxetine in combination with tamoxifen are at increased risk for death. Other SSRIs, including citalopram, escitalopram, are weak or negligible inhibitors of CYP2D6 and are less likely to interact with anticancer drugs, while sertraline causes significant inhibition of this isoform only at high doses. Hypericum extract, by inducing both the CYP3A4 and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), can reduce the plasma concentrations of different antineoplastic agents such as imatinib, irinotecan and docetaxel, thus reducing the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Although these interactions are often predictable, the use of fluoxetine, paroxetine and Hypericum extract should be avoided in cancer patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21395523/"}

Targeted therapy was administered to match the P1K3CA , c-MET , and SPARC and COX2 aberrations with sirolimus+ crizotinib and abraxane+ celecoxib . In Patient #2, aberrations included NF2 loss in exons 2-16, PDGFR\u03b1 amplification, and TP53 mutation. This patient was enrolled on a clinical trial combining targeted agents temsirolimus, sorafenib and bevacizumab, to match NF2, PDGFR\u03b1 and TP53 aberrations. Both the patients did not benefit from matched therapy. ### conclusions Relapsed osteosarcoma is characterized by complex signaling and drug resistance pathways. Comprehensive molecular profiling holds great promise for tailoring personalized therapies for cancer. Methods for such profiling are evolving and need to be refined to better assist clinicians in making treatment decisions based on the large amount of data that results from this type of testing. Further research in this area is warranted.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510912/"}

Consenting patients with newly diagnosed, resectable, high-grade osteosarcoma aged 40 years or younger were eligible for randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either postoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (MAP) or MAP plus ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE) using concealed permuted blocks with three stratification factors: trial group; location of tumour (proximal femur or proximal humerus vs other limb vs axial skeleton); and presence of metastases (no vs yes or possible). The MAP regimen consisted of cisplatin 120 mg/m ### findings Between April 14, 2005, and June 30, 2011, 2260 patients were registered from 325 sites in 17 countries. 618 patients with poor response were randomly assigned; 310 to receive MAP and 308 to receive MAPIE. Median follow-up was 62\u00b71 months (IQR 46\u00b76-76\u00b76); 62\u00b73 months (IQR 46\u00b79-77\u00b71) for the MAP group and 61\u00b71 months (IQR 46\u00b75-75\u00b73) for the MAPIE group. 307 event-free survival events were reported (153 in the MAP group vs 154 in the MAPIE group). 193 deaths were reported (101 in the MAP group vs 92 in the MAPIE group). Event-free survival did not differ between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b798 [95% CI 0\u00b778-1\u00b723]); hazards were non-proportional (p=0\u00b70003). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (268 [89%] patients in MAP vs 268 [90%] in MAPIE), thrombocytopenia (231 [78% in MAP vs 248 [83%] in MAPIE), and febrile neutropenia without documented infection (149 [50%] in MAP vs 217 [73%] in MAPIE). MAPIE was associated with more frequent grade 4 non-haematological toxicity than MAP (35 [12%] of 301 in the MAP group vs 71 [24%] of 298 in the MAPIE group). Two patients died during postoperative therapy, one from infection (although their absolute neutrophil count was normal), which was definitely related to their MAP treatment (specifically doxorubicin and cisplatin), and one from left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which was probably related to MAPIE treatment (specifically doxorubicin). One suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction was reported in the MAP group: bone marrow infarction due to methotrexate. ### interpretation EURAMOS-1 results do not support the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to postoperative chemotherapy in patients with poorly responding osteosarcoma because its administration was associated with increased toxicity without improving event-free survival .

The minimal or moderate survival benefit-depending on prognostic features-and the severe toxicity associated with the MVAC regimen have made the search for new drugs and drug combinations of utmost importance to increase efficacy and/or decrease toxicity. In this respect, the taxanes and gemcitabine are promising new drugs. Paclitaxel and docetaxel as single agents have yielded overall response rates of 7 % to 56 % , depending on whether the patients have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease . The combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin has been explored in three studies with a total of 104 evaluable patients, a pooled overall response (OR) rate of 61%, and a complete response (CR) rate of 20%. There are two studies of docetaxel and cisplatin with a total of 91 evaluable patients, an OR rate of 54%, and a CR rate of 16%. The OR rate for paclitaxel and carboplatin in six studies was 43%, with a CR rate of 13%; however, the reported median survival was only 8.5 to 9.5 months. The OR rate for single-agent gemcitabine based on five studies was 26%, with a CR rate of 9%, which was apparently independent of whether the patients had received prior chemotherapy. The OR rate for gemcitabine and cisplatin in four phase II studies ranged from 41% to 57%, with a CR rate of 15% to 22% and a median survival of 12.5 to 14.3 months. Based on the encouraging results for the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC), a randomized phase III trial comparing GC and MVAC was begun in late 1996. This study of 405 randomized patients showed that the two regimens were associated with similar response rates, time to progression, and overall survival, whereas GC was associated with less toxicity than MVAC. On the basis of this superior risk-benefit ratio, the GC regimen should be favored as a new standard treatment in patients with locally advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer. Other promising combinations include gemcitabine and paclitaxel, with or without cisplatin, and the combination of ifosfamide, paclitaxel, and cisplatin.

PATIENTS AND METHODS RNA was extracted from 1,372 tumor blocks from postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer in the monotherapy arms of ATAC. Twenty-one genes were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and the RS was calculated. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the value of adding RS to a model with clinical variables (age, tumor size, grade, and treatment) in node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N+) women. RESULTS Reportable scores were available from 1,231 evaluable patients (N0, n = 872; N+, n = 306; and node status unknown, n = 53); 72, 74, and six DRs occurred in N0, N+, and node status unknown patients, respectively. For both N0 and N+ patients, RS was significantly associated with time to DR in multivariate analyses (P < .001 for N0 and P = .002 for N+). RS also showed significant prognostic value beyond that provided by Adjuvant! Online (P < .001). Nine-year DR rates in low (RS < 18), intermediate (RS = 18 to 30), and high RS (RS > or = 31) groups were 4%, 12%, and 25%, respectively, in N0 patients and 17%, 28%, and 49%, respectively, in N+ patients. The prognostic value of RS was similar in anastrozole- and tamoxifen-treated patients.

Given the availability of a number of alternative biologic treatment options and other novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinicians are faced with an increasingly challenging choice regarding optimal treatment. Biologics are usually combined with traditional DMARDs, primarily methotrexate (MTX), but some biologics and tofacitinib (together referred to in this article as novel DMARDs) have been shown to be efficacious as monotherapy as well. In real-world practice, approximately one-third of RA patients receiving biologics are on monotherapy, primarily because of intolerance of, or noncompliance with, MTX. Limited data, however, are available analyzing the effectiveness of monotherapy compared with combination therapy across novel DMARDs. ### objective To compare American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses to approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) at 24 weeks in RA patients who have shown inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (DMARD-IR). ### methods Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified randomized controlled trials that assessed approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with MTX in DMARD-IR RA patients. Twenty-eight RCTs were identified that evaluated abatacept, anakinra, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib. ACR responses at 24 weeks were extracted and combined by means of Bayesian network meta-analyses. ### results With the exception of anakinra plus MTX, which was less efficacious, most novel DMARDs, when used in combination with MTX, demonstrated comparable ACR responses. When novel DMARDs were used as monotherapies , greater ACR20/50/70 responses were observed with tocilizumab than with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents ( aTNF ) or tofacitinib . Furthermore, ACR20/50/70 responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab monotherapy (odds ratio [OR] for the indirect comparison\u2009=\u20091.08, 95% credible interval [CrI]\u2009=\u20090.40-2.84; OR\u2009=\u20091.24, CrI\u2009=\u20090.44-3.61; OR\u2009=\u20090.95, CrI\u2009=\u20090.33-2.72, respectively), whereas greater responses were observed with aTNF plus MTX than with aTNF monotherapy (OR\u2009=\u20092.41, CrI\u2009=\u20090.51-11.61; OR\u2009=\u20092.85, CrI\u2009=\u20090.51-17.67; OR\u2009=\u20091.28, CrI\u2009=\u20090.21-8.42, respectively). Relative efficacy estimates for the indirect comparison of tofacitinib plus MTX with tofacitinib monotherapy were very uncertain. ### conclusions Results suggest that in combination with MTX most of the available novel DMARDs have similar levels of efficacy in DMARD-IR patients. As monotherapy, however, tocilizumab displayed higher ACR responses than aTNF or tofacitinib. ACR responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab as monotherapy, whereas aTNF in combination with MTX demonstrated greater ACR responses than aTNF as monotherapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25943002/"}

Of 47 patients with disease limited to the bone, 16 (34%) had a PR to therapy based on decrease in pretreatment PSA of more than 50%. Overall, 24 (39%) of 62 patients demonstrated a decrease in pretreatment PSA levels of at least 50% from baseline. Twenty-two patients received previous chemotherapy. There were no differences in survival or disease response in patients treated with previous chemotherapy compared with untreated patients. Pretreatment hemoglobin, PSA, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase levels were not significant prognostic factors, but performance status was an important predictor of survival. ### conclusions We conclude that the combination of oral estramustine (10 mg/kg/day) and oral etoposide (50 mg/m2/day) is an active regimen for hormone refractory prostate cancer.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9301705/"}

Late antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) triggered by donor-specific antibodies (DSA) is a cardinal cause of kidney allograft dysfunction and loss. Diagnostic criteria for this rejection type are well established, but effective treatment remains a major challenge. Recent randomized controlled trials ( RCT ) have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of widely used therapies , such as rituximab plus intravenous immunoglobulin or proteasome inhibition ( bortezomib ) , reinforcing a great need for new therapeutic concepts . One promising target in this context may be interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine known to play an important role in inflammation and adaptive immunity. ### methods This investigator-driven RCT was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of clazakizumab, a genetically engineered humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6. The study will include 20 DSA-positive kidney allograft recipients diagnosed with ABMR \u2265\u2009365\u2009days after transplantation. Participants will be recruited at two study sites in Austria and Germany (Medical University of Vienna; Charit\u00e9 University Medicine Berlin). First, patients will enter a three-month double-blind RCT (1,1 randomization, stratification according to ABMR phenotype and study site) and will receive either clazakizumab (subcutaneous administration of 25\u2009mg in monthly intervals) or placebo. In a second open-label part of the trial (months 4-12), all patients will receive clazakizumab at 25\u2009mg every month. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints are the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clazakizumab, its effect on drug metabolism in the liver, DSA characteristics, morphological ABMR lesions and molecular gene expression patterns in three- and 12-month protocol biopsies, serum/urinary biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial activation/injury, Torque Teno viral load as a measure of overall immunosuppression, kidney function, urinary protein excretion, as well as transplant and patient survival. ### discussion Currently, there is no treatment proven to be effective in halting the progression of late ABMR. Based on the hypothesis that antagonizing the effects of IL-6 improves the outcome of DSA-positive late ABMR by counteracting DSA-triggered inflammation and B cell/plasma cell-driven alloimmunity, we suggest that our trial has the potential to provide proof of concept of a novel treatment of this type of rejection. ### Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03444103 .

The current study evaluated whether ephedrine or phenylephrine better restores uterine blood flow and fetal oxygenation during ritodrine infusion and epidural anesthesia-induced hypotension in gravid ewes. ### methods Fourteen chronically instrumented gravid ewes between 0.8 and 0.9 timed gestational age were used. On separate days, each animal underwent the experimental protocol with one of three agents: ephedrine, phenylephrine, and normal saline-control. The experimental protocol was as follows : ( 1 ) at time zero , intravenous infusion of ritodrine was begun ; ( 2 ) at 120 min , 2 % lidocaine was given epidurally to achieve a sensory level of at least T6 ; and ( 3 ) at 135 min , an intravenous bolus of either ephedrine , phenylephrine , or normal saline-control was given , followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of the same agent for 30 min . In the ephedrine and phenylephrine experiments, the rate of infusion was adjusted to maintain maternal mean arterial pressure close to baseline. ### results ritodrine infusion alone significantly increased maternal heart rate and cardiac output in all three groups. Epidural anesthesia during ritodrine infusion significantly decreased maternal mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, uterine blood flow, and fetal arterial oxygen tension for each of the three groups.

The thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine (TBF) protocol has recently demonstrated promising outcome in cord blood and haploidentical SCT; however, there is limited evidence about this regimen in transplant from matched siblings (MSD) and unrelated donors (UD). We retrospectively compared outcomes of 2523 patients aged 18-50 with AML in remission, undergoing transplant from MSD or UD prepared with either TBF or BuCy conditioning. A 1:3 pair-matched analysis was performed: 146 patients receiving TBF were compared with 438 patients receiving BuCy.

Reactivity of factor IXa with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is enhanced by low molecular weight heparin ( enoxaparin ) .

We examined the reactivity of factor IXa with several isolated Kunitz-type inhibitor domains: basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2, and the first two inhibitor domains of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. We find that enhancement of factor IXa reactivity by enoxaparin is greatest for basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (>10-fold), followed by the second tissue factor pathway inhibitor domain (1.7-fold) and the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2 (1.4-fold). Modeling studies of factor IXa with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor suggest that binding of this inhibitor is sterically hindered by the 99-loop of factor IXa, specifically residue Lys(98).

In the NSABP B-42 study, we aimed to determine whether extended letrozole treatment improves disease-free survival after 5 years of aromatase inhibitor-based therapy in women with postmenopausal breast cancer. ### methods This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done in 158 centres in the USA, Canada, and Ireland. Postmenopausal women with stage I-IIIA hormone receptor-positive breast cancer , who were disease-free after about 5 years of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor , were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) to receive 5 years of letrozole ( 2\u00b75 mg orally per day ) or placebo .

Objective Some previous studies have found clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and cilostazol for prevention of secondary stroke, but the physiological mechanism involved remains unknown. We aimed to clarify the effects of aspirin/cilostazol therapy on the platelet and endothelial functions of patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, in comparison to patients who were treated with aspirin alone. Methods The present randomized prospective pilot study enrolled 24 patients within a week after the onset of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (100 mg/day) (A group; 11 patients) or cilostazol (200 mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day) (CA group; 13 patients). We measured platelet aggregation, platelet activation, and the thrombomodulin (TM), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and von Willebrand (vWF) antigen levels and vWF activity over a 4-week period after enrollment. Results There was no significant difference in the platelet functions of the A and CA groups. However, the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was decreased at 2 and 4 weeks (p<0.05) after treatment in comparison to the pre-treatment values in the CA group, but not in the A group. Platelet activation, and the hs-CRP, TM, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and vWF values did not significantly decrease after treatment in either group. Conclusion Although there were no significant differences in platelet aggregation, platelet activation or the endothelial biomarker levels of the A and CA groups, dual therapy with aspirin and cilostazol inhibited platelet aggregation in comparison to the pre-treatment values, similarly to patients who received aspirin alone. This may suggest the clinical usefulness of dual therapy with aspirin and cilostazol in the treatment of patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28566591/"}

The pertinent downstream mediators of antitumor efficacy were tested in transient transfection and RNA interference experiments. ### results Cyclin E1 mRNA and protein expressions were suppressed after sorafenib treatment in sorafenib-sensitive but not in sorafenib-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Changes in cyclin E2 or D1 were not correlated with sorafenib sensitivity. The knockdown of cyclin E1 expression reversed the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to sorafenib in terms of cell growth and apoptosis induction, whereas the overexpression of cyclin E1 increased the resistance to sorafenib. The growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects of sorafenib were enhanced by flavopiridol, and Mcl-1 suppression was determined to play a critical role in mediating this enhancing effect. ### conclusions The cyclin E1 suppression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells may serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for predicting sorafenib efficacy.

Each camel received a single oral dose of closantel (10 mg/kg) plus albendazole (5 mg/kg) orally. Two weeks later, 20 camels of this group were re-dosed again with the same dose of the anthelmintic. Fecal samples were collected per rectum from all camels at the time of treatment and again 14 and 42 days post treatment. Fecal egg counts and generic determination of third stage larvae was performed. Results indicated that six different species of gastrointestinal tract parasites were identified in camels. Single treatment of closantel plus albendazole mixture reduced egg counts in camels by 100 % , 100 % , 98 % and 77 % for Haemonchus longistipes , Ascaris spp . , Monezia expansa and Fasciola hepatica , respectively . However, administration of the drug twice on the base of 2 weeks apart significantly raised the efficacy of the drug for clearance of the parasites from 92.5% to 100% in camels infected with various parasites.

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors modulate signaling pathways involved in cell cycle progression, and recent phase II trials demonstrate activity in patients with endometrial cancer. Our objective was to examine the effects of combination therapy with rapamycin and paclitaxel in endometrial cancer cell lines. paclitaxel inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines with IC(50) values of 0.1-0.5 nM and 1-5 nM for Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells, respectively. To assess synergy of paclitaxel and rapamycin, the combination index (CI) was calculated by the method of Chou and Talalay. Simultaneous exposure of cells to various doses of paclitaxel in combination with rapamycin (1 nM) resulted in a significant synergistic anti-proliferative effect (CI <1, range 0.131-0.920). rapamycin alone did not induce apoptosis, but combined treatment with paclitaxel increased apoptosis over that of paclitaxel alone. Treatment with rapamycin and paclitaxel resulted in decreased phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 , two critical downstream targets of the mTOR pathway . rapamycin decreased hTERT mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR while paclitaxel alone had no effect on telomerase activity. paclitaxel increased polymerization and acetylation of tubulin, and rapamycin appeared to enhance this effect.

The basiliximab protocol did not increase rejection; the percentage of rejection episodes was high-risk basiliximab, 0; high-risk CsA, 13; and low-risk CsA, 3 (p = .13). ### conclusion basiliximab induction therapy allows delayed initiation of cyclosporine after cardiac transplantation without an increase in rejection and reduces the risk of post-operative renal dysfunction.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16143252/"}

The randomised phase 3 TURANDOT trial compared two approved bevacizumab-containing regimens for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in terms of efficacy, safety, and quality of life. The interim analysis did not confirm non-inferior overall survival (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b704; 97\u00b75% repeated CI [RCI] -\u221e to 1\u00b769). Here we report final results of our study aiming to show non-inferior overall survival with first-line bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. ### methods In this multinational, open-label, randomised phase 3 TURANDOT trial, patients aged 18 years or older who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2 and measurable or non-measurable HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had received no previous chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were stratified and randomly assigned (1:1) using permuted blocks of size six to either bevacizumab plus paclitaxel (bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks) or bevacizumab plus capecitabine (bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on day 1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 every 3 weeks) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Stratification factors were oestrogen or progesterone receptor status, country, and menopausal status. The primary objective was to show non-inferior overall survival with bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel in the per-protocol population by rejecting the null hypothesis of inferiority (HR \u22651\u00b733) using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00600340. ### findings Between Sept 10, 2008, and Aug 30, 2010, 564 patients were randomised, representing the intent-to-treat population. The per-protocol population comprised 531 patients (266 in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group and 265 in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group). At the final overall survival analysis after 183 deaths (69%) in 266 patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and 201 (76%) in 265 receiving bevacizumab plus capecitabine in the per-protocol population, median overall survival was 30\u00b72 months (95% CI 25\u00b76-32\u00b76 months) versus 26\u00b71 months (22\u00b73-29\u00b70), respectively. The stratified HR was 1\u00b702 (97\u00b75% RCI -\u221e to 1\u00b726; repeated p=0\u00b70070), indicating non-inferiority. The unstratified Cox model (HR 1\u00b713 [97\u00b75% RCI -\u221e to 1\u00b739]; repeated p=0\u00b7061) did not support the primary analysis. Intent-to-treat analyses were consistent with the per-protocol results. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (54 [19%] of 284 patients in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group vs 5 [2%] of 277 patients in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group), hand-foot syndrome (1 [<1%] vs 43 [16%]), peripheral neuropathy (39 [14%] vs 1 [<1%]), leucopenia (20 [7%] vs 1 [<1%]), and hypertension (12 [4%] vs 16 [6%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 65 (23%) of 284 patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and 68 (25%) of 277 receiving bevacizumab plus capecitabine. Deaths in two (1%) of 284 patients in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group were deemed by the investigator to be treatment-related. No treatment-related deaths occurred in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group. ### interpretation bevacizumab plus capecitabine represents a valid first-line treatment option for HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, offering good tolerability without compromising overall survival compared with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel. Although progression-free survival with the bevacizumab plus capecitabine combination is inferior to that noted with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel, we suggest that physicians should consider possible predictive risk factors for overall survival, individual's treatment priorities, and the differing safety profiles. ### funding Roche.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27501767/"}

She underwent rectectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil , leucovorin plus oxaliplatin for stage IIIB rectal cancer . Three years later, she presented with dysphagia and cough. Computed tomography showed thickening of the esophagus wall, enlargement of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum and abdomen, and ground-glass opacities in the right lung. Endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor of the midthoracic esophagus. Histopathological analysis of the tumor biopsy showed infiltration of adenocarcinoma cells into the stroma of the esophagus; tumor cells were positive for caudal type homeobox 2 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1. A transbronchial biopsy indicated pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis of rectal adenocarcinoma. Based on those findings, she was diagnosed with recurrent rectal cancer. She received fluorouracil-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, which ameliorated her symptoms and induced a durable response without severe adverse events.

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity. ### objective To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone. ### Design Setting And Participants Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012. ### interventions Cephalexin , 500 mg 4 times daily , plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily , for 7 days ( n = 248 participants ) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days ( n = 248 participants ) . ### Main Outcomes And Measures The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%. ### results Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly. ### Conclusions And Relevance Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed. ### Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00729937.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535235/"}

After 2 cycles with bortezomib at a reduced dose (1.0 mg/m2 twice weekly for 2 weeks followed by a 10-day rest period) to evaluate tolerability and renal toxicity, the patient completed another 3 cycles at the standard dose (1.3 mg/m2) in combination with dexamethasone (20 mg on the day of bortezomib administration and the day after). This led to an improvement of the renal function with a reduction of serum and urinary M-protein (serum creatinine 1.4 mg/dL; serum IgGkappa M-protein, 2.9 g/dL; proteinuria, 2 g/d; kappa light-chain level in urine, 0.7 g/L). The patient developed thrombocytopenia but did not suffer from some of the more severe adverse events associated with bortezomib, such as infection or peripheral neuropathy, even at full dose. ### conclusion We report an elderly patient with refractory MM and progression with renal failure who responded to bortezomib treatment. bortezomib was well tolerated in this patient.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16860177/"}

Retinal hemangioblastoma is the ocular hallmark lesion of von Hippel-Lindau disease. ### Case Presentation A 20-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our institution with painless visual impairment in the right eye. A fundus ophthalmoscopic evaluation and swept-source optical coherence tomographic examination revealed a retinal hemangioblastoma associated with cystoid macular edema. On the basis of the clinical ocular findings and genetic analysis, von Hippel-Lindau disease was diagnosed. Following an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab , off-label administration of intravitreal dexamethasone was considered to reduce the edema . An almost complete resolution of the edema in the macular area was observed 1 week after the injection. Finally, laser photocoagulation and transconjunctival cryotherapy were performed; the patient developed \"ablatio fugax\" after cryotherapy. ### conclusions In our experience, intravitreal dexamethasone administration has proven to be a useful tool for reducing retinal hemangioblastoma-related macular edema in von Hippel-Lindau disease and may be considered a potentially valuable treatment that can be used in combination with other therapies.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30185211/"}

Gastric ulcer symptom relief with rabeprazole was similar or superior to that provided by omeprazole or placebo. In 8-week studies in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), rabeprazole 10, 20 and 40 mg/day were more effective than placebo, rabeprazole 20 mg/day was more effective than ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, and rabeprazole 20 mg/day was similar in efficacy to omeprazole 20 mg/day.

The drug was as effective as omeprazole and lansoprazole as part of triple therapy for H. pylori eradication. rabeprazole successfully reduced acid output to target levels and prevented further pathological changes in 10 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Usual dosages of rabeprazole are 20 mg/day for 4 weeks to treat duodenal ulcers, 6 weeks for gastric ulcers and 8 weeks for GERD, although some patients with duodenal ulcer may respond to a 10 mg/day dosage. For long term maintenance of GERD healing, 10 or 20 mg daily doses are adequate. Patients with hypersecretory states may need individualised dosages starting at 60 mg/day. The drug was well tolerated in clinical trials, with headache, rash, infection, diarrhoea and flu syndrome as the most common adverse events. In conclusion, rabeprazole appears to be a well tolerated proton pump inhibitor with a rapid onset of action and a low potential for drug interactions.

It is too early to evaluate four patients at present. The remaining 12 received three or more courses of treatment, and three of these patients achieved a complete response. Another four patients went into partial remission, amounting to an overall response rate of 58%. The other evaluable patients showed stable disease with improved symptoms. Hematologic toxicity was mainly granulocytopenia, but thrombocytopenia occurred in two patients. Alopecia, nausea, and vomiting were attributed to the cyclophosphamide component of the therapy. mitoxantrone appeared to have no cardiac toxicity. It was concluded that mitoxantrone-cyclophosphamide is an effective chemotherapeutic combination with minimal toxicity and should be further studied in larger controlled trials.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6385260/"}

Efficacy of liraglutide therapy was significantly associated with baseline insulin dosage and post-breakfast glycemia with BOT. The C-statistic of the model was calculated to be 0.90. ### conclusions There were responders and non-responders to liraglutide therapy in Japanese BOT failures. It is likely that baseline insulin dosage and post-breakfast glycemia with BOT are clinically useful indicators for the efficacy of liraglutide therapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24843616/"}

Since melanoma cells and tissue contain relatively large amounts of histamine, the functional significance of histamine was examined using specific antihistamines in vitro and in vivo in the human melanoma cell line HT168 and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. It was shown that the H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine when combined with N , N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]-ethanamine-HCl ( DPPE ) , a tamoxifen derivate , inhibits the proliferation of HT168 cells . Furthermore, it is suggested that there is a factor(s) that interferes with the exponential growth of HT168 cells xenografted to immunodeficient mice, and cimetidine and DPPE together significantly influence this factor(s). This combination of antihistamines also increases the survival of human melanoma-grafted mice. These changes are accompanied by enhanced infiltration of interferon-gamma- producing mouse macrophages into the tumour tissue.

The standard of care and novel treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are reviewed. ### summary Recent advances in the treatment of CLL have dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape for both patients and health care professionals. The majority of conventional first-line therapies are noncurative and are only used to treat disease that is symptomatic or progressive and include chlorambucil, monotherapy with purine analogues, and combination chemotherapy. Immunotherapeutic agents such as rituximab and alemtuzumab may be indicated in select patient populations. However, because clinical trials have found that overall survival does not depend on the initial therapy, selection of first-line therapy should be based on patient-specific factors and the patient's goals for therapy with respect to response, survival, and symptom palliation. Progression-free survival time and time to treatment are critical endpoints for CLL treatment. An increasingly important endpoint is minimal residual disease (MRD), as it is considered to be the major cause of relapse in CLL. Finally, comparison of toxicities between different therapies is critical in CLL, as it is in other disease states. Several new agents are currently being evaluated for use in CLL, including alvocidib, oblimersen, and lumiliximab. ### conclusion Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients with CLL. The introduction of rituximab , alemtuzumab , and bendamustine has improved the current outlook for patients with CLL . As overall survival does not appear to depend on the initial therapy, treatment should be selected based on patient-specific factors and goals.

Fibrosing, non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (non-IPF) interstitial lung diseases (fILDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by a different amount of inflammation and fibrosis. Therapy is currently based on corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators. However, response to these therapies is highly variable, sometimes without meaningful improvement, especially in more fibrosing forms. pirfenidone and nintedanib have recently demonstrated to reduce functional decline in patients with IPF. However, their antifibrotic mechanism makes these two drugs an interesting approach for treatment of fibrosing ILDs other than IPF. ### objectives We here report our experience with antifibrotic drugs in fibrosing non-IPF ILDs patients having a progressive phenotype during immunosuppressive therapy. ### methods Patients with a multidisciplinary team diagnosis of fibrosing non-IPF ILDs experiencing a progressive phenotype during treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators between October-2014 and January-2018 at our tertiary referral Center for ILDs were retrospectively analyzed.

High-dose chemotherapy or radio-chemotherapy followed by autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a potentially curative treatment approach; however, the applicability of this approach is restricted to patients responding to second-line chemotherapy.

The model compared tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day (BID) either as monotherapy or in combination with MTX with similarly labeled biologic therapies. Response to treatment was modeled as American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 response. ACR20 represented clinical response and determined whether patients continued therapy. ACR response rates at 6-month intervals were sourced from prescribing information and safety event rates from a published meta-analysis. Following an adverse event or a lack of response to treatment, it was assumed that 75% of patients switched to the next line of treatment (first to abatacept and then to rituximab). The perspective was that of a U.S. payer. Costs were reported in 2015 U.S. dollars and included drug wholesale acquisition costs, monitoring, drug administration, and treatment for minor and serious adverse events. The patient population eligible for treatment was based on the total number of members (i.e., RA and non-RA) in a payer organization; members with RA treated with biologic therapies were estimated using epidemiological data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of varying key parameters, including treatment-switching probability, product rebate, major rates of adverse drug reaction, and ACR20 rates, on the model outcomes. ### results tofacitinib combination therapy after MTX failure was associated with the lowest cost per member per month (PMPM) over a 2-year time frame at $5.53, compared with $6.49 for adalimumab, $6.43 for etanercept, $5.95 for certolizumab, and $5.89 for tocilizumab. Similar savings were observed when all biologics were administered as monotherapy. Tofacitinib combination therapy was also associated with the lower PMPM cost compared with adalimumab combination therapy in the TNF-IR analysis . tofacitinib was also among the lowest cost per ACR20 responder in each analysis. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that tofacitinib would potentially be cost saving even in the least optimistic scenarios. ### conclusions This analysis suggests that tofacitinib 5 mg BID following MTX failure is a lower cost per patient treatment option when used either as monotherapy or combination therapy, compared with adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab and tocilizumab biologic regimens. tofacitinib + MTX in TNF-IR patients was also predicted to be a lower-cost treatment option compared with adalimumab+MTX and was associated with the lowest cost per ACR 20/50/70 responder. ### disclosures This study was funded by Pfizer, which determined the research topic and paid York Health Economics Consortium to develop the analysis and conduct the research.

However their impact on cortical bone quality and bone strength is not clear. ### methods Six-month old female rats were either sham operated or ovariectomized (OVX). OVX rats were left untreated for two months and then were treated with vehicle (Veh), hPTH (1-34) (PTH), alendronate (Aln), or raloxifene (Ral) sequentially for three month intervals, for a total of three periods. Mid-tibial cortical bone architecture, mass, mineralization, and strength were measured on necropsy samples obtained after each period. Bone indentation properties were measured on proximal femur necropsy samples. ### results Eight or more months of estrogen deficiency in rats resulted in decreased cortical bone area and thickness. Treatment with PTH for 3months caused the deposition of endocortical lamellar bone that increased cortical bone area, thickness, and strength. These improvements were lost when PTH was withdrawn without followup treatment, but were maintained for the maximum times tested, six months with Ral and three months with Aln. Pre-treatment with anti-resorptives was also somewhat successful in ultimately preserving the additional endocortical lamellar bone formed under PTH treatment. These treatments did not affect bone indentation properties. ### summary Sequential therapy that involved both PTH and anti-resorptive agents was required to achieve lasting improvements in cortical area, thickness, and strength in OVX rats.

The survival depends on the pathologic stage and varies from 30%-60% for stage III to 60%-80% for stage II. However, as much as 40%-50% of patients will relapse and require additional treatment of the disease. Clinical failure after resection of CRC is predominantly secondary to the clinical progression of previously undetected distant metastatic disease. Until very recently, the absolute benefit for survival obtained with adjuvant therapy compared with control was about 6%. Introduction of oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting has shown a reduction of 23% in the risk of relapse when compared with 5-fluorouracil alone (MOSAIC).

Isolated rabbit hearts (Langendorff technique) were submitted to increased left ventricular stretch at the left wall by insertion of an additional intraventricular balloon and adjusting the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) to 25 mmHg for 10 min followed by 20 min recovery at normal EDP of 5-8 mmHg.

Without treatment, patients with inoperable or metastatic colorectal cancer have a median life expectancy of about 8 months. The following article is an update of our 2005 review of chemotherapy regimens used in metastatic colorectal cancer, based on the standard Prescrire methodology. In 2005, the de Gramont protocol, based on fluorouracil (always combined with folinic acid) plus either oxaliplatin (Folfox protocol) or irinotecan (Folfiri protocol), was the standard first-line chemotherapy in this setting. Four trials comparing monotherapy versus combination therapy in previously untreated patients showed that initial fluorouracil (or fluorouracil precursor) monotherapy, followed by the Folfox or Folfiri protocol in case of failure, was not associated with shorter overall survival. Two trials compared first-line treatment with the Folfiri regimen versus the Folfoxiri regimen (fluorouracil + oxaliplatin + irinotecan). One of these studies showed an increase in median survival with the Folfoxiri protocol (24 versus 17 months), but at a cost of greater neurotoxicity. The only tangible advantage of capecitabine and tegafur, two oral fluorouracil precursors, is their convenience of use. pemetrexed was less effective and more toxic than the Folfiri protocol in one trial. bevacizumab and panitumumab have yielded disappointing results in previously untreated patients. Neither of these monoclonal antibodies has yet been shown to improve overall survival. Three trials have assessed the addition of cetuximab to combinations consisting of fluorouracil or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin or irinotecan. In two of these trials, the median survival time of patients whose tumours carried the wild-type KRAS gene was about 3 months longer in the cetuximab arms, although the increase was statistically significant in only one trial. cetuximab had no impact on survival time in the third trial. In two trials , an anti-EGFR antibody ( panitumumab or cetuximab ) reduced median survival when added to bevacizumab in previously untreated patients . When progression occurs after treatment with the Folfiri protocol (or equivalent), a combination of the Folfox protocol and bevacizumab seems to increase median survival time by about 2 months versus Folfox alone, but it is also more toxic. In patients who progress after receiving the fluorouracil + oxaliplatin combination (Folfox) or the fluorouracil+ irinotecan combination (Folfiri), neither panitumumab nor cetuximab has been shown to provide a clinically meaningful increase in overall survival. It remains to be shown whether these drugs are more effective in patients with the wild-type KRAS gene than in patients with KRAS mutations. In early 2010, the standard cytotoxic drugs for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer are fluorouracil (combined with folinic acid), oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Initial combination therapy may be beneficial when the metastases are borderline operable. When the metastases are inoperable and are unlikely to become operable after chemotherapy, it seems best to begin treatment with single-agent fluorouracil (+ folinic acid) or capecitabine. The use of monoclonal antibodies in first-line treatment of patients with colorectal cancer is not justified. Further trials of these drugs are warranted as second-line treatment for patients with KRAS wild-type tumours.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21180382/"}

The pivotal consideration is whether there are adequate benefits with combination hormonal therapy in terms of increased survival and decreased disease progression to outweigh the increased risk of adverse events and additional cost. The most recent meta-analysis by the Prostate Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group indicates a small but statistically significant survival benefit with combination hormonal therapy using nonsteroidal antiandrogens.

When comparing individual versus simultaneous drug administration, the only pharmacokinetic alteration observed was a statistically significant but minor (about 10%) decrease in sulbactam renal clearance, on both days 1 and 7, resulting in a similar decrease in total body clearance (CL). The area under the curve, apparent volume of distribution by the area method (V), t1/2, and Cmax were not significantly altered. Although cefoperazone pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly altered when comparing single-agent to combination drug administration, the area under the curve was slightly lower and CL, nonrenal clearance, and V were modestly higher from day 1 to day 7. Because Cmax and t1/2 were unaffected, these minor day effects would not be of clinical significance. Intravenous administration of cefoperazone and sulbactam given as individual agents compared with the combination did not show pharmacokinetic differences that are likely to produce clinically relevant effects . The combination of cefoperazone and sulbactam was well tolerated, and the safety profile of the combination was similar to that either drug given alone under the conditions of this study.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3348612/"}

We examined the use of IL-2 and growth factors for mobilization, ex vivo activation of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) and maintenance therapy after HDC/AHST in metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients with metastatic breast cancer for HDC/AHST were assigned to 1 of 3 protocols for PBSC mobilization: G-CSF (group 1); IL-2 + G-CSF (group 2); or IL-2 + G-CSF + GM-CSF (group 3).

In this trial, we evaluated the perioperative effects on C-reactive protein (CRP) that resulted from starting atorvastatin within seven days of noncardiac surgery. The objective was to identify anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin prior to conducting a large randomized trial with clinical end points. ### methods In a single centre, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial, sixty high cardiac risk participants over age 45 yr undergoing noncardiac surgery were assigned randomly to one of three groups to receive atorvastatin 80 mg (A) and/or placebo (P). Group AA (n = 26) received atorvastatin seven days before surgery, the day of surgery, and for seven days post surgery.

In this work, we first designed a pertuzumab plant biosimilar (PPB) and investigated the composition of its Asn297-linked glycan in comparison with trastuzumab plant biosimilar (TPB). Both biosimilars were produced in wild-type (WT) Nicotiana benthamiana plant (PPB-WT and TPB-WT) and transgenic \u0394XTFT N. benthamiana plant with XT and FT genes knockout (PPB-\u0394XTFT and TPB-\u0394XTFT). Western blot analysis with anti-\u03b11,3-fucose and anti-xylose antibodies, as well as a test with peptide-N-glycosidase F, confirmed the absence of \u03b11,3-fucose and xylose in the Asn297-linked glycan of PPB-\u0394XTFT and TPB-\u0394XTFT.

Hepatitis C virus infection affects around 3% of the world population or approximately 160 million people. A variable proportion (5% to 40%) of the infected people develop clinical symptoms. Hence, hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality with hepatic fibrosis, end-stage liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma as the dominant clinical sequelae. Combination therapy with pegylated (peg) interferon-alpha and ribavirin achieves sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment) in approximately 40% to 80% of treated patients, depending on viral genotype. Recently, a new class of drugs have emerged for hepatitis C infection, the direct acting antivirals, which in combination with standard therapy or alone can lead to sustained virological response in 80% or more of treated patients. Aminoadamantanes, mostly amantadine, are antiviral drugs used for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. We have previously systematically reviewed amantadine versus placebo or no intervention and found no significant effects of the amantadine on all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and on adverse events in patients with hepatitis C. Overall, we did not observe a significant effect of amantadine on sustained virological response. In this review, we systematically review aminoadamantanes versus other antiviral drugs. ### objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of aminoadamantanes versus other antiviral drugs for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection by conducting a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials. ### Search Methods The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (1996 to December 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11 of 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to December 2013), EMBASE (1974 to December 2013), Science Citation Index EXPANDED (1900 to December 2013), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp), Google Scholar, and Eudrapharm up to December 2013. Furthermore, full text searches were conducted until December 2013. ### Selection Criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing aminoadamantanes in participants with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. ### Data Collection And Analysis Two authors independently extracted data. RevMan Analysis was used for statistical analysis of dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Methodological domains were used to assess the risk of systematic errors ('bias'). We used trial sequential analysis to assess risk of random errors ('play of chance'). ### Main Results Six randomised clinical trials with 581 participants with chronic hepatitis C were included. All trials had high risk of bias. The included trials compared amantadine versus other antiviral drugs: ribavirin, mycophenolate mofetil, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma. Standard antiviral therapy (interferon-alpha, interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, or peg interferon alpha) was administered equally to the intervention and the control groups in five trials, depending on when the trial was conducted. Four trials compared amantadine versus ribavirin. There were no deaths or liver-related morbidity in the two intervention groups (0/216 (0%) versus 0/211 (0%); 4 trials; very low quality of the evidence). The lower estimated risk for (serious) adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation with amantadine was imprecise (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.16; based on 10/216 (5%) versus 18/211 (9%) participants in 4 trials; very low quality of the evidence). There were more participants with failure of sustained virological response in the amantadine group than in the ribavirin group (206/216 (96%) versus 176/211 (84%); RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22, 4 trials; low quality of the evidence). amantadine versus ribavirin more often failed to achieve end-of follow-up biochemical response (41/46 (89%) versus 31/46 (67%); RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.63; 2 trials; very low quality of the evidence). One trial compared amantadine versus mycophenolate mofetil. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups , except that amantadine was inferior to mycophenolate mofetil regarding the outcome failure to achieve end-of treatment virological response ( low quality of evidence ) . One trial each compared amantadine versus interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma. Both comparisons showed no significant differences in the treatment outcomes (very low quality of the evidence). The observed effects could be due to real effects, systematic errors (bias), or random errors (play of chance). This possible influence on the observed effect by play of chance is due to the fact that trial sequential analyses could not confirm our findings. We were not able to perform meta-analyses on failure of histological improvement and quality of life due to lack of valid data in all trial comparisons. ### Authors Conclusions This systematic review has identified evidence of very low quality for the key outcomes of all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and adverse events in people with chronic hepatitis C when treated with amantadine compared with ribavirin, mycophenolate, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma. The timeframe for measuring the composite outcome was insufficient in the included trials. There was low quality evidence that amantadine led to more participants who failed to achieve sustained virological response compared with ribavirin. This observation may be real or caused by systematic errors (bias), but it does not seem to be caused by random error (play of chance). Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are unable to determine definitively whether amantadine is less effective than other antivirals in patients with chronic hepatitis C. As it appears less likely that future trials assessing amantadine or potentially other aminoadamantanes for patients with chronic hepatitis C would show strong benefits, it is probably better to focus on the assessments of other direct acting antiviral drugs. We found no evidence assessing other aminoadamantanes in randomised clinical trials in order to recommend or refute their use.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24937404/"}
