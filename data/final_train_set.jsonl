Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been intensively investigated as a promising cancer treatment strategy. The specific mechanism of cetuximab endocytosis and its influence on cetuximab uptake, biodistribution and efficacy still remain elusive. Recently, statins have been reported to synergize with EGFR-targeting agents. Our prior work established that nystatin, a cholesterol-sequestering antifungal drug, facilitates endocytosis via the clathrin-dependent pathway. This study aimed to investigate whether nystatin regulates the uptake and efficacy of cetuximab and cetuximab-based antibody-drug conjugates (cetuximab-ADCs). In vitro and in vivo efficacies of nystatin on the uptake and activity of cetuximab/cetuximab-ADCs were studied in multiple human carcinoma cell lines and xenograft models, respectively. We identified that cholesterol sequestration by nystatin enhanced cetuximab internalization in EGFR-positive carcinoma cells by regulating EGFR trafficking/turnover and facilitating a switch from lipid rafts to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Combination treatment with cetuximab and nystatin selectively increased cetuximab uptake by tumor tissues , translating into potentiated antitumor efficacy of cetuximab in vivo ( A431 and A549 tumors ) . Nystatin-enhanced internalization of cetuximab further improved the uptake and potency of cetuximab-doxorubicin and cetuximab-methotrexate conjugates in EGFR-positive cetuximab-resistant tumors. Combination therapy with nystatin plus either cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC further prolonged animal survival and significantly suppressed tumor growth, as compared with single-agent cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC. In summary, our results identify a novel mechanism whereby cholesterol sequestration enhances the uptake of EGFR-targeting mAb and ADCs, therefore providing preclinical proof-of-concept that combination with nystatin can potentiate the delivery and efficacy of these EGFR-targeted agents.

The responses to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and a STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 in primarily cultured ependymoma cells were measured by cell viability assay. Apoptosis assays were conducted to reveal the cytotoxic mechanism of applied agents. Knockdown of STAT3 was tried to confirm the effects of STAT3 inhibition in ependymoma cells. High levels of phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) expression were observed in ependymoma tissue, especially in the anaplastic histology group. There was no cytotoxic effect of cisplatin , ifosfamide , and etoposide . Both brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) and bulk tumor cells (BCs) showed considerably decreased viability after WP1066 treatment. However, BTICs had fewer responses than BCs. No additive or synergistic effect was observed for combination therapy of WP1066 and cisplatin. WP1066 effectively abrogated p-STAT3 expression. An increased apoptosis and decreased Survivin expression were observed after WP1066 treatment. Knockdown of STAT3 also decreased cell survival, supporting the critical role of STAT3 in sustaining ependymoma cells. In this study, we observed a cytotoxic effect of STAT3 inhibitor on ependymoma BTICs and BCs. There is urgent need to develop new therapeutic agents for pediatric ependymoma. STAT3 inhibitors may be a new group of drugs for clinical application. ", "source": null}

This two-drug regimen, with carboplatin dosed using the Calvert formula, yielded convincing noninferior outcomes when compared with the prior, more toxic, regimen of cisplatin/paclitaxel. Carboplatin's dose-limiting toxicity is thrombocytopenia; however, when this drug is properly dosed and combined with paclitaxel, the doublet's cycle 1 dose in chemotherapy-naive women is generally safe. Carboplatin (unlike cisplatin) contributes minimally to the cumulative sensory neuropathy of paclitaxel, thus ensuring noticeable reversibility of neuropathy symptoms following completion of 6 cycles and only occasionally requiring cessation or substitution of the taxane. Paclitaxel is responsible for the hair loss associated with the carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet; preventive measures must be considered for patients who would otherwise refuse treatment. Several first-line phase III trials , as well as ongoing trials for which only preliminary results have been published , have fueled debates on the optimal dose and schedule ; these have focused not only on weekly vs q3-weeks paclitaxel , but also on other modifications and the advisability of adding bevacizumab . Our view is that results of this doublet in the first-line treatment of ovarian cancer are driven primarily by carboplatin, given that ovarian cancer is a platinum-sensitive disease. Consequently, the roles of the accompanying paclitaxel dose and schedule and the addition of bevacizumab are currently unsettled, and questions regarding these issues should be decided based on patient tolerance and comorbidities until additional data are available.", "source": null}

As part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence single technology appraisal process, brodalumab was assessed to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of its use in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics Technology Assessment Group at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article provides a summary of the Evidence Review Group's review of the company's submission, the Evidence Review Group report and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance issued in March 2018. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from three well-conducted, multicentre, double-blind randomised controlled trials. The trials demonstrated that brodalumab statistically significantly reduced the severity of psoriasis and its impact on health-related quality of life, compared with placebo, at 12\u00a0weeks. In comparison with ustekinumab, statistically significantly more patients taking brodalumab had reduced psoriasis severity at 12\u00a0weeks. Psoriasis severity and quality of life also appeared improved at 52\u00a0weeks, although statistical significance was not assessed. Withdrawal rates were comparable to drug survival rates of other biological therapies and rates of adverse events were similar between brodalumab and ustekinumab . A network meta-analysis was presented, comparing brodalumab with other therapies available at the same point in the treatment pathway (i.e. in patients for whom standard systemic therapy or phototherapy is inadequately effective, not tolerated or contraindicated). The network meta-analysis ranked treatments in order of effectiveness, in terms of achieving different levels of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index response. The results indicated that brodalumab had a similar probability of response to ixekizumab, secukinumab and infliximab and a higher probability of response than ustekinumab, adalimumab, etanercept, apremilast, dimethyl fumarate and placebo. The company's economic model compared nine treatment sequences that included three lines of active therapy, consisting of brodalumab and other comparators recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, followed by best supportive care. The sequence with brodalumab in the first-line position dominated sequences that started with adalimumab, infliximab, secukinumab and ustekinumab. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the brodalumab sequence compared to less effective and non-dominated sequences ranged from \u00a37145 (vs. the etanercept sequence) to \u00a313,353 (vs. the dimethyl fumarate sequence) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the more costly and effective ixekizumab sequence was \u00a3894,010 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared to the brodalumab sequence. At a threshold of \u00a320,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, the brodalumab sequence had the highest probability of being cost effective (96%). The main limitation of the company's economic model was the restrictive nature of the sequences compared. Twelve separate scenarios based on key uncertainties were explored by the Evidence Review Group. The only scenarios where brodalumab was ranked lower than first were not considered to be more appropriate or plausible than the assumptions or scenarios included in the company's base case. The treatment rankings identified in the Evidence Review Group's alternative base case were identical to those derived from the company's base case model. At the first National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee meeting, the Committee concluded that brodalumab appears to be as effective as other anti-interleukin-17 agents and is cost effective, based on the discount agreed in the patient access scheme. Brodalumab is recommended as an option for treating adults with severe plaque psoriasis (defined by a total Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score of 10 or more and a Dermatology Life Quality Index score of more than 10) who have not responded to other systemic non-biological therapies. Brodalumab should be stopped at 12\u00a0weeks if the psoriasis has not responded adequately.", "source": null}

Despite improvements in detection and management, metastatic breast cancer remains a leading cause of death among women in industrialized countries. Chemotherapy is the initial treatment of choice for patients with a negative estrogen receptor status, as well as for those with a positive estrogen receptor status who have failed to respond to endocrine treatment. Patients who fail on first-line chemotherapy become candidates for second-line salvage chemotherapy; the outlook for these patients is poor, and new active agents continue to be sought. docetaxel (Taxotere; Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer, Antony, France) is a semisynthetic taxoid that is an inhibitor of microtubule depolymerization. This new anticancer agent has been studied in an extensive phase II clinical trial program involving 162 patients with second-line metastatic breast cancer, 134 of whom were anthracycline resistant. Doses of 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel, administered over 1 hour every 3 weeks, produced an overall response rate of 50% (range, 41% to 58%) in 129 evaluable patients, with a median duration of 6 months (range, 2 to 17 months). The response rates achieved to date with docetaxel in anthracycline-resistant patients compare favorably with those produced by the best monotherapies currently available, and are equivalent to those achieved with current combination chemotherapy options. docetaxel also was found to be highly effective in patients with a poor prognosis, having metastases in three or more organs (53%), and/or visceral sites of disease (47%).

In children with uninhibited contractions or poor compliance 150 to 300 mg. lidocaine were instilled for 8 minutes and cystometry was repeated. Changes in bladder capacity and compliance, number of uninhibited contractions and bladder volume at which pressure of 40 cm. H2O was reached were recorded before and after the lidocaine instillation. Clinical response to subsequent treatment with oral oxybutynin was assessed from chart review. ### results A total of 48 urodynamic studies in 22 girls and 20 boys with a mean age plus or minus standard deviation of 8.3 +/- 5.7 years and myelomeningocele were evaluable. After instillation of lidocaine, urodynamics showed increased bladder capacity in 70.8% of studies (34 of 48), with an average increase in volume of 66% (p <0.05). No change or decreased bladder capacity occurred in 29.2% of studies. Bladder compliance improved in 61.7% of the studies (29 of 47, p <0.05) and worsened in 38.3%. Bladder volume at which the pressure of 40 cm. H2O was reached increased in 77.8% of studies (14 of 18, p <0.05).

Correlation of lidocaine induced changes in bladder capacity , compliance and number of uninhibited contractions with improvement on oral oxybutynin was 70.6 % , 64.3 % and 66.7 % , respectively . ### conclusions Intravesical lidocaine can improve bladder capacity and compliance and decrease the number of uninhibited contractions in many children with neurogenic bladder caused by myelomeningocele. These observations suggest that intravesical lidocaine has effects on the neurogenic bladder that improve bladder dynamics. Although intravesical lidocaine testing may not reliably predict clinical response to oral oxybutynin at the prescribed dosages, a possible therapeutic role for intravesical lidocaine or similar agents should be explored further.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11371945/"}

Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a group of uncommon and heterogeneous malignancies arising from a postthymic or mature T-lymphocyte. The treatment of PTCL remains a challenging endeavor. Compared with the more common aggressive B-cell lymphomas, more patients with PTCL will be refractory to initial therapy and those who achieve responses often will have shorter progression-free survival. Despite retrospective data that suggest that anthracycline-based multiagent chemotherapy regimens may not provide a benefit compared with nonanthracycline regimens, nonanthracycline-based regimens, with the notable exception of L-asparaginase regimens for extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, have been disappointing so far. Based on phase II evidence and subset analyses available, we believe that the addition of etoposide to standard regimens and consolidation of first remissions with autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) provides the best outcome in patients with PTCL and currently use CHOEP followed by ASCT for eligible patients with the common PTCL subtype: PTCL-NOS, AITL, and ALK negative ALCL. For those with ALK-positive ALCL standard CHOP or CHOEP is appropriate with consideration of ASCT only for those with high-risk disease. Other strategies to incorporate additional agents, such as with dose-adjusted EPOCH or sequential CHOP-ICE regimens are logical options; however, they lack the supporting literature of CHOEP. Whereas the above recommendation is our current off-protocol approach, with the possible exception of low risk ALK positive ALCL, none of these choices is supported by strong enough data to supplant a well-conceived clinical trial as the truly preferred strategy in PTCL. The novel agents , romidepsin , pralatrexate , and brentuximab vedotin , are currently approved in the relapsed/refractory setting . These agents are being studied as additions or substitutions for other agents in up-front multiagent chemotherapy regimens. In the relapsed/refractory setting, both pralatrexate and romidepsin remain well-studied choices with some patients achieving a response with durability. Clinical trials of new agents in PTCL continue to be a valuable option and an important part of routine patient management as progressive disease often is seen. Lastly, we believe patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL should be considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation if a suitable response is demonstrated and a willing donor is available.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23568456/"}

Resistance to trastuzumab is a major issue in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Several potential resistance mechanisms have been investigated, but the results are controversial and no conclusion has been reached. erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) may function in cell growth, and expressed in various cancer cells. Because the downstream signaling pathways for EPOR and HER2 partially overlapped, we hypothesized that EPOR may play a role in the inhibition effect of trastuzumab and resistance to trastuzumab. Here, we detected the expression of EPOR mRNA and protein in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines and tissues. EPOR expressed in SKBR3, MDA-MB-453, and UACC-812 cell lines, but not in BT474. Of the 55 HER2-positive cancer tissues, EPOR was positive in 42 samples and highly expressed (H-score \u2265 25) in 24 by immunohistochemistry. The difference between EPOR expression and Ki67 index was significant (P = 0.033), and EPOR expression also positively correlated with higher pathological stage (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.359; P = 0.007). Exogenous EPO antagonized trastuzumab-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in HER2/EPOR dual-positive breast cancer cells. We then exposed SKBR3 cells to trastuzumab for 4 months to obtain trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cell line, which demonstrated higher phosphorylated EPOR level, higher EPO expression and more extracellular secretion than non-resistant parental SKBR3 cells. Downregulation EPOR expression using short hairpin RNA resensitized trastuzumab-resistant cells to this drug, and SKBR3 cells with EPOR downregulation demonstrated attenuated trastuzumab resistance after the same resistance induction. EPOR downregulation plus trastuzumab produced a synergetic action in the inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-453 cell lines. Therefore, EPOR expression may be involved in tumor progression and proliferation in HER2-positive breast cancer. EPO/EPOR contributes to the mechanism of trastuzumab resistance in SKBR3 cell lines, and EPOR downregulation can reverse the resistance to trastuzumab and increase the inhibition effect of this drug.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23117856/"}

Recent clinical work has questioned the safety of a combined therapy of oral quinidine and intravenous verapamil , because some patients were reported to react with severe hypotension probably due to drug interactions with vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors . In order to obtain further quantitative information on the underlying mechanism, we used the radioligands (3H)-prazosin and (3H)-yohimbine to perform binding studies on intact cells, with predominantly alpha-1 (isolated myocytes) or alpha-2 subtypes (human platelets) of adrenergic receptors. Our studies confirm that both verapamil and quinidine possess a distinct alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking activity and do not discriminate between the alpha-1 and alpha-2 subtype (Ki-values were between 0.24-0.28 mumol/l for alpha-1 receptors and 0.49-0.50 mumol/l for alpha-2 receptors). Their interaction was competitive and in the presence of both drugs inhibition of radioligand binding was additive. The alpha-adrenergic blockade by verapamil was stereospecific as D-verapamil increased the dissociation constant of the radioligand to a much lesser degree than L-verapamil (Ki = 1.67 +/- 0.29 mumol/l for D-verapamil). The calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, a 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative, did not show any competition up to concentrations of 10 mumol/l. Our results thus give evidence that verapamil and quinidine have already at therapeutic blood levels significant alpha-adrenergic blocking activities which may be of clinical interest.

Osteosarcomas (OS), especially those with metastatic or unresectable disease, have limited treatment options. The greatest advancement in treatments occurred in the 1980s when multi-agent chemotherapy, including doxorubicin, cisplatin, high-dose methotrexate, and, in some regimens, ifosfamide, was demonstrated to improve overall survival compared with surgery alone. However, standard chemotherapeutic options have been limited by poor response rates in patients with relapsed or advanced cases. It has been reported that VEGFR expression correlates with the outcome of patients with osteosarcoma and circulating VEGF level has been associated with the development of lung metastasis. At present , it seems to us that progress has not been made since Grignani reported a phase II cohort trial of sorafenib and sorafenib combined with everolimus for advanced osteosarcoma , which , in a sense , have become a milestone as a second-line therapy for osteosarcoma . Although the recognization of muramyltripepetide phosphatidyl-ethanolamine has made some progress based on its combination with standard chemotherapy, its effect on refractory cases is controversial. Personalized comprehensive molecular profiling of high-risk osteosarcoma up to now has not changed the therapeutic prospect of advanced osteosarcoma significantly.

In the present studies, we assessed the effect of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and determined whether the functional activity of L-type calcium channels is altered after repeated cocaine administration. Rats were administered daily intraperitoneal injections of either flunarizine (40 mg/kg), diltiazem (40 mg/kg) or cocaine (20 mg/kg) and the combination of the CCBs and cocaine for 30 days.

Maximal augmentation of behavioral response to repeated cocaine administration was observed on Day 18. Flunarizine pretreatment abolished the augmented behavioral response to repeated cocaine administration while diltiazem was less effective . Measurement of tissue monoamine levels on Day 18 revealed cocaine-induced increases in DA and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens. By contrast to behavioral response, diltiazem was more effective in attenuating increases in monoamine levels than flunarizine. Cocaine administration for 18 days produced increases in calcium uptake in synaptosomes prepared from the nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex. Increases in calcium uptake were abolished by flunarizine and diltiazem pretreatment. Taken together, the augmented cocaine-induced behavioral response on Day 18 may be due to increased calcium uptake in the nucleus accumbens leading to increased dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) release. flunarizine and diltiazem attenuated the behavioral response by decreasing calcium uptake and decreasing neurochemical release.", "source": null}

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and the azure A assay were used to evaluate interactions between dendrimers and enoxaparin. The efficacy of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers in enhancing pulmonary absorption of enoxaparin was studied by administering enoxaparin-dendrimer formulations into the lungs of anesthetized rats and monitoring drug absorption by measuring plasma anti-factor Xa activity. The optimized formulations were evaluated for their efficacy in preventing deep vein thrombosis in a rodent model. The safety of the formulations was tested by studying their effects on mucociliary transport rate (MTR) in a frog palate model and by measuring injury markers in rat bronchoalveolar fluid. The FTIR data and azure A assay revealed ionic interactions between the amino groups of cationic dendrimers and the carboxylic and sulfate groups of enoxaparin. Positively charged dendrimers increased the relative bioavailability of enoxaparin by 40%, while a negatively charged dendrimer had no effect.

Afterward, differential mobility of L, T, and C along the reactor is induced by an electric field. The combination of differential mobility of reactants and their interactions leads to a change of the EM peak shape. This change is a function of rate constants, so the rate and equilibrium constants can be directly determined from the analysis of the EM peak shape (width and symmetry) and propagation pattern along the reactor.

This review establishes the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the major nucleoside analogues with cytotoxic activity. cytarabine, pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine and gemcitabine are all prodrugs whose plasma pharmacokinetics do not fully reflect their therapeutic activity; after cellular uptake, these compounds undergo phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase before their incorporation into DNA results in cell death. cytarabine is principally active in the S phase of the cell cycle and is most toxic to replicating cells, whereas pentostatin, fludarabine and cladribine are incorporated into DNA during the process in which strand breaks are repaired and are therefore cytotoxic to slowly replicating cells (although the action of pentostatin results from its inhibition of adenosine deaminase). gemcitabine is unusual in being highly metabolised in solid tumour cells. The cytotoxic activity of pentostatin, fludarabine and cladribine against the clonal cells of lymphoproliferative disorders is accompanied by damage to normal lymphoid cells, which results in significant and long-lasting immunosuppression. Useful interactions between nucleoside analogues have been defined. Cells that are primed by exposure to fludarabine or cladribine exhibit enhanced accumulation of cytarabine triphosphate (the cytotoxic nucleotide of cytarabine) and an improved therapeutic effect against acute myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia can be achieved by clinical schedules that exploit this effect. Combinations of alkylating agents and fludarabine or cladribine are also synergistic in producing significantly enhanced activity against refractory lymphoid malignancies , but at the cost of increased haematological toxicity . Developments in the clinical administration of gemcitabine are concentrating on efforts to extend the duration of exposure to the drug as a means of counteracting its rapid catabolism in the circulation. Future developments with this group of agents will further explore the use of fludarabine-based combination therapies to produce a transient period of myelosuppression and immunosuppression that is sufficient to permit the engraftment of allogeneic haemopoietic stem cells and also exploit the immunological benefits of graft-versus-tumour reactions.

This is further complicated by clinical trials not commonly reporting adverse events by age.

Dysregulation of this pathway occurs in more than one-third of all malignancies, a process that has fostered the development of targeted Map kinase pathway inhibitors. Cutaneous melanomas, which arise from skin melanocytes, are the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Mutations that activate the Map kinase pathway occur in more than 90% of these melanomas. This has led to the development of the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib or vemurafenib and cobimetanib for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutant melanomas. dabrafenib and vemurafenib target V600E/K BRAF mutants while trametinib and cobimetanib target MEK1/2. The latter two agents bind to MEK1/2 at a site that is adjacent to, but separate from, the ATP-binding site and are therefore classified as type III allosteric protein kinase inhibitors. These agents form a hydrogen bond with a conserved \u03b23-lysine and they make numerous hydrophobic contacts with residues within the \u03b1C-helix, the \u03b25 strand, and within the activation segment, regions of the protein kinase domain that exhibit greater diversity than those found within the ATP-binding site. One advantage of such allosteric inhibitors is that they do not have to compete with millimolar concentrations of cellular ATP, which most FDA-approved small molecule competitive inhibitors such as imatinib must do. Owing to the wide spread activation of this pathway in numerous neoplasms , trametinib and cobimetinib are being studied in combination with other targeted and cytotoxic drugs in a variety of clinical situations .

We asked whether the gene expression of 3D spheroids would reveal mechanisms of resistance. To address this, we measured gene expression of three mesothelioma cell lines, M28, REN and VAMT, grown as 2D monolayers and 3D spheroids. A total of 209 genes were differentially expressed in common by the three cell lines in 3D (138 upregulated and 71 downregulated), although a clear resistance pathway was not apparent. We then compared the list of 3D genes with two publicly available datasets of gene expression of 56 pleural mesotheliomas compared to normal tissues. Interestingly, only three genes were increased in both 3D spheroids and human tumors: argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), annexin A4 (ANXA4) and major vault protein (MVP); of these, ASS1 was the only consistently upregulated of the three genes by qRT-PCR. To measure ASS1 protein expression, we stained 2 sets of tissue microarrays (TMA): one with 88 pleural mesothelioma samples and the other with additional 88 pleural mesotheliomas paired with matched normal tissues.

Therefore, the antibiotic hypersensitivity of pss-8 differs from previously reported hypersensitivities, associated with lipopolysaccharide defects. These results suggest that the polar phospholipid headgroups may play an important role in maintaining the barrier function of the outer gramnegative membrane and that putative inhibitors of the phosphatidylserine synthetase might potentiate the action of numerous antibiotics currently in clinical use.", "source": null}

In seven men and women (20-27 yr of age), up to four ventral forearm skin sites were instrumented with intradermal microdialysis fibers for localized drug delivery during cooling.

Previous reports revealed that nicotine activates the locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic (NAergic) system and this mechanism may underlie its beta-adrenoceptor sensitive LLP effects. clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is also known to activate the LC. Interactions between nicotine and clozapine are of interest because of the prevalence of smoking in patients with schizophrenia and increasing interest in the use of nicotinic receptor ligands as cognitive enhancers. Rats were subchronically primed with nicotine , clozapine or saline . Twenty-one to twenty-eight days later, the effects of the nicotine, clozapine or saline challenge on the evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) at the MPP-DG monosynaptic pathway were recorded as a measure of LLP. We confirmed the hypothesis that a challenge dose of either nicotine or clozapine induces LLP exclusively in nicotine- and clozapine-primed rats, and not in saline-primed rats, thus indicating a cross-priming effect. Moreover, unilateral suppression of LC using lidocaine abolished the LLP induced by nicotine in clozapine-primed rats. Furthermore, systemic treatment with clonidine (an \u03b12 adrenoceptor agonist that reduces NAergic activity via autoreceptors) prior to the challenge doses blocked the nicotine/clozapine-induced LLP in nicotine- and clozapine-primed rats.

Single agents with a proven activity in a first-line setting include 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, mitomycin C, cisplatin, taxanes (docetaxel and paclitaxel) and oral fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine and TS-1).

Irradiation was performed with total 45 Gy at the right lower pulmonary lobe. She relapsed 29 months later at the pleura between the right middle and lower pulmonary lobe. Tumor resection and total 45 Gy of irradiation were performed again. High-dose chemotherapy comprising cisplatin, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide was performed followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). The patient achieved complete hematologic recovery. Thirty-one months after PBSCT, no signs of relapse have been observed. Although it might be that the patient could have been cured with second surgery alone or by the surgery and subsequent chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy and PBSCT should be considered for the treatment of relapsed PPB.", "source": null}

Hypertensive crises are further defined as either hypertensive emergencies or urgencies, depending on the degree of blood pressure elevation and presence of end-organ damage. Immediate reduction in blood pressure is required only in patients with acute end-organ damage (i.e. hypertensive emergency) and requires treatment with a titratable, short-acting, intravenous antihypertensive agent, while severe hypertension without acute end-organ damage (i.e. hypertensive urgency) is usually treated with oral antihypertensive agents.

According to the follow-up results, the median time to the progression of pleural effusion in endostatin group was markedly longer than that in Cisplatin group (p=0.008). ### conclusions Compared with the thoracic hyperthermic perfusion with cisplatin alone, the thoracic hyperthermic perfusion with recombinant human endostatin plus nedaplatin showed dramatically potential efficacy, decrease of the incidence rate of adverse reactions in the digestive system, improvement of quality of life of patients, and prolongation of progression of pleural effusion.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33455108/"}

Proof of concept in animal models. In the present work, we have evaluated the possibility of preventing liver carcinogenesis in rats at two stages of development. In the first series of experiments, we induced foci of altered hepatocytes, (FAH) which represent the first events in rodent liver carcinogenesis, using the chemical mutagens diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and acetylaminofluorene (AAF). In the second part of the work, we used repeated weekly injections of DEN only that gave rise to significant fibrosis at 11 weeks and the development of malignant tumours at 16 weeks. We chose to assess the chemopreventive effect of three different drugs : pioglitazone , lanreotide and S-trans-trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid ( FTS ) . pioglitazone (PGZ) is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg), itself a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, responsible for the modulation of a number of metabolic pathways, including cell differentiation, metabolism of lipids and inflammation. lanreotide (LAN) is a somatostatin analogue that has an inhibitory effect on the release of several hormones, such as growth hormone and serotonine. FTS is a specific antagonist of the protoocogene Ras, tested here based on the rationale that Ras is activated in many hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We showed that both PGZ and LAN were efficient in the first, pre-neoplastic model, by reducing the size of FAH, decreasing proliferation specifically in FAH by interacting with proteins of the cell cycle. We could also demonstrate that LAN increased apoptosis. In the second model, LAN was able to diminish the number of established HCC by decreasing proliferation, in parallel with an anti-fibrotic action. Furthermore, enhanced apoptosis and antiangiogenic effects were observed when LAN was given from the start of the carcinogenic induction by DEN. The cellular mechanisms leading to its effects warrant further investigations. FTS also strongly inhibited the appearance of FAH and HCC in the second model, through a complete inhibition of Ras activation and the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways. On the contrary, PGZ did not prevent the appearance of neoplastic lesions. For these reasons, we did not analyse further its mechanism of action in the second model. Altogether, the results we obtained demonstrate an activity of both LAN and FTS, at the early onset of liver carcinogenesis, and later on when advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC are induced. These anti-tumoural effects could be complementary and will be tested in combination in the future.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21563652/"}

Generic statins could change the cost effectiveness of statin therapies in Spain, and more population groups could be included in the recommendations for reduction of cholesterol levels based on cost effectiveness. ### objectives The objectives of this study were: (i) to assess the cost effectiveness of available statins for the reduction of LDL-C levels in Spain in 2010, after the introduction of generics and reference prices; (ii) to assess the cost effectiveness of combination therapy using a statin plus cholestyramine or ezetimibe; and (iii) to estimate the mean cost per patient to achieve National Cholesterol Education Program (Adult Treatment Panel-III) therapeutic objectives. ### methods The following treatments were evaluated: rosuvastatin 5-20\u2009mg/day; atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin 10-40\u2009mg/day; lovastatin and fluvastatin 20-80\u2009mg/day; and combination therapy with a statin plus either cholestyramine 12-24\u2009g/day or ezetimibe 10\u2009mg/day. The cost effectiveness was evaluated in terms of cost per percentage point reduction in LDL-C, comparing the annual treatment costs with the effectiveness in reducing LDL-C. Treatment costs included those for medications (2010 wholesale prices), control measures, and treatment of adverse drug effects. The effectiveness of statins was estimated by developing a meta-analysis of clinical trials published between 1993 and 2005 that met several inclusion criteria. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to assess the efficiency of individual statin and combination therapies in reducing LDL-C levels. ### results The effectiveness in terms of percentage reduction in LDL-C ranged from 19% for pravastatin 10\u2009mg/day to 55% for atorvastatin 80\u2009mg/day. Annual treatment costs ranged from Euro 189.7 for simvastatin 10\u2009mg/day to Euro 759.3 for atorvastatin 80\u2009mg/day. The cost-effectiveness ratios, in terms of cost per percentage point reduction in LDL-C, were: Euro 6 for simvastatin, Euro 10-12 for rosuvastatin, Euro 10 for lovastatin, Euro 13-16 for atorvastatin, Euro 13-14 for fluvastatin, and Euro 14-20 for pravastatin. Rosuvastatin + ezetimibe , simvastatin + ezetimibe , and atorvastatin + ezetimibe were the most cost-effective combination therapies for reducing LDL-C levels . rosuvastatin was the most cost-effective statin for achieving the LDL-C therapeutic goal in patients at high risk for CHD, with a mean cost per patient of Euro 516. simvastatin was the most cost-effective statin to achieve the LDL-C goal in patients with moderate or low CHD risk, with a cost per patient of Euro 217 and Euro 190, respectively. ### conclusion rosuvastatin should be the first-choice agent in patients with high CHD risk, while simvastatin should be the first choice in patients with moderate or low risk.

The two nonapeptides arginine vasopressin and oxytocin are not only secreted from the neurohypophysis into the general circulation but are also released intracerebrally. Our recent research has focused on the release patterns and effects of oxytocin and vasopressin in brain areas, such as the septum and hypothalamus, that are thought to be involved in the regulation of (1) behavioural responses and (2) responses of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system (HNS) to stressor exposure in rats. The results demonstrate that combined physical and emotional stress (induced by exposure to forced swimming) selectively triggers the release of vasopressin within all brain areas under study but not into the general circulation. Under emotional stress conditions (induced by exposure to the 'social defeat' procedure), however, oxytocin rather than vasopressin release increased within the hypothalamus and septum. Experiments aimed at revealing the neuroendocrine and behavioural relevance of the local nonapeptide release provided evidence for an involvement of vasopressin in the regulation of HNS activity (within the hypothalamus) and, moreover, in acute stress-coping strategies, anxiety-related behaviour and learning and memory processes (within the septum). The observed dissociation between central and peripheral nonapeptide release not only supports the hypothesis that plasma vasopressin and oxytocin concentrations do not necessarily reflect central release patterns but also suggests vasopressin and oxytocin neurones are able to independently release their nonapeptide from different parts of their neuronal surface (e.g. from somata/dendrites vs. axon terminals). This remarkable regulatory capacity provides the basis for an differential involvement of vasopressin, and probably also oxytocin, in the co-ordination of neuroendocrine activity, emotionality and cognition at different brain levels to ensure an appropriate behavioural response of the organism to stressful stimuli.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10795914/"}

We compared patient-reported outcomes (PRO) during CRT in patients who had received induction chemotherapy versus those who did not. ### Patients And Methods We reviewed records of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were treated with CRT between September 2009 and October 2014, and who had completed\u00a0\u2265 4 PRO assessments during treatment. Clinician- and patient-reported toxicities were collected each week during treatment. We fit binomial generalized linear models to maximum toxicity scores across all patients' visits. ### results Of 123 patients with\u00a0\u2265 4 PRO assessments, 87 (71%) patients reported a clinically meaningful PRO score of 3 or higher for diarrhea, and 91 (74%) patients reported a PRO score of\u00a0\u2265 3 for urgency, during 1 or more weeks of treatment, corresponding to 'very frequent' or worse. Of 116 patients who had also completed\u00a0\u2265 4 clinician-reported assessments for descriptive analysis, clinically significant diarrhea (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade\u00a0\u2265 2) was reported in 9% of patients, and grade 2 proctitis and cystitis were reported in 20% and 4%, respectively. Eighty-four (68%) patients had undergone induction chemotherapy prior to CRT. Patients who received induction chemotherapy had 68% lower odds of experiencing significant urgency (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.95; P\u00a0= .04), 76% lower odds of bleeding (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.1-0.62; P\u00a0< .01), and 75% lower odds of tenesmus (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.6; P\u00a0< .01) versus those treated with upfront CRT. ### conclusion Based on PROs, a high proportion of patients experienced clinically significant symptoms during pelvic CRT, with diarrhea and urgency being most commonly reported. This appears to be under-reported on clinician-reported assessments. Delivery of induction chemotherapy was associated with lower odds of experiencing urgency, bleeding, and tenesmus on PROs during subsequent CRT, with no significant impact on diarrhea and rectal pain.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104990/"}

PAR-1, -2, -3, and -4 were widely expressed in the normal brain, and their levels were increased in the ischemic brain, especially in the peri-ischemic lesion. warfarin pretreatment enhanced the expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 in the peri-ischemic lesion, whereas rivaroxaban pretreatment did not. The present study shows a lower risk of brain hemorrhage in rivaroxaban-pretreated compared with warfarin-pretreated rats following tPA administration to the ischemic brain.

The use of artemisinin derivative-based combination therapy (ACT) such as artesunate plus amodiaquine is currently recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Fixed-dose combinations are more adapted to patients than regimens involving multiple tablets and improve treatment compliance. A fixed-dose combination of artesunate + amodiaquine ( ASAQ ) was recently developed . To assess the efficacy and safety of this new combination and to define its optimum dosage regimen (once or twice daily) in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, a multicentre clinical study was conducted. ### methods A multicentre, randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, parallel-group study was conducted in five African centers in Cameroon, Madagascar, Mali and Senegal from March to December 2006. Efficacy and safety of ASAQ were assessed compared to those of artemether + lumefantrine (AL). The WHO protocol with a 28-day follow-up for assessing the drug therapeutic efficacy was used. Patients suffering from uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were randomized to receive ASAQ orally once daily (ASAQ1), ASAQ twice daily (ASAQ2) or AL twice daily (AL) for three days. The primary outcome was PCR-corrected parasitological cure rate and clinical response. ### results Of 941 patients initially randomized and stratified into two age groups (<5 years, and >or=5 years), 936 (99.5%) were retained for the intent to treat (ITT) analysis, and 859 (91.3%) patients for the per protocol (PP) analysis. Among ITT population, up to D28, PCR-corrected adequate parasitological and clinical response rates were 95.2% in the ASAQ1 group, 94.9% in the ASAQ2 group and 95.5% in the AL group. Moreover, the cure rate evaluated among PP population was >or=98.5% in both ASAQ therapeutic arms. Therapeutic response rates did not display any significant differences between age groups or between one geographical site and another. Altogether, this demonstrates the non-inferiority of ASAQ1 regimen compared to both ASAQ2 and AL regimens. During follow-up mild and moderate adverse events including gastrointestinal and/or nervous disorders were reported in 29.3% of patients, with no difference between groups in the nature, frequency or intensity of adverse events. ### conclusion The non-inferiority of ASAQ compared with AL was demonstrated. The fixed-dose combination artesunate + amodiaquine (ASAQ) is safe and efficacious even in young children under 5 years of age. Whilst administration on a twice-a-day basis does not improve the efficacy of ASAQ significantly, a once-a-day intake of this new combination clearly appears as an effective and safe therapy in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria both in adults and children. Implications of such findings are of primary importance in terms of public health especially in African countries. As most national policies plan to strengthen malaria control to reach the elimination of this disease, anti-malarial drugs such as the artesunate + amodiaquine fixed-dose ACT will play a pivotal role in this process. ### Trial Registration The protocol was registered with the www.clinicaltrials.gov open clinical trial registry under the identifier number NCT00316329.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19505304/"}

Twenty-one received norethisterone (5 mg twice a day on days 19 and 26) and 25 received tranexamic acid (1 g four times daily on days 1 to 4) for two cycles. ### Main Outcome Measures Menstrual blood loss was measured using the alkaline haematin method. Haematological assessments were made both at the beginning and at the end of the study, questionnaires were given to assess subjective endpoints, and patients were asked to report any adverse events during all cycles. ### results tranexamic acid reduced mean menstrual blood loss by 45%, from 175 ml to 97 ml (95% CI for the difference in menstrual blood loss 52 to 108, P < 0.0001), norethisterone increased mean blood loss by 20% from 173 ml to 208 ml (95% CI for the difference in menstrual blood loss -64 to 2, P = 0.26). Fourteen (56%) women who received tranexamic acid achieved a mean menstrual loss of less than 80 ml per cycle during treatment, but only two (9.5%) who received norethisterone achieved this mean menstrual loss.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a hematological malignancy with unfavorable prognosis. Novel therapeutic approaches for treating the disease are aimed at the mechanisms regulating growth signals, cellular proliferation, and survival pathways of the malignant clones. bortezomib (Brt), a proteasome inhibitor with pleiotropic activities was shown to be active in MCL and is currently implemented in therapeutic combinations for this disease. Telomerase activity is essential for survival of malignant cells and as such is considered a valid therapeutic target. This study evaluated the effects of bortezomib on telomerase activity and its regulation in MCL cells in vitro and ex vivo. Our study shows that bortezomib exerts a cytotoxic effect in a dose dependent manner in two MCL cell lines, with differential sensitivity. While the IC50 for HBL-2 cells ranged between 2.5 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml during 24-72 h respectively, the IC50 for the NCEB cells was twice. bortezomib differentially inhibited telomerase activity (TA): in HBL-2 cells there was a decline of 20%-55% during 24-72 h respectively. However in NCEB cells the decline was much smaller, and did not exceed 25%. Inhibition of telomerase activity is shown to be operated by two separate mechanisms: reduction of the hTERT mRNA expression (controlled by the binding of transcription factors) and reduction in phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of hTERT by its kinases, AKT and PKC\u03b1. A decrease in telomerase activity was demonstrated also in mononuclear cells, isolated from three MCL patients following incubation of the cells in the presence of bortezomib for 24-72 h. In one patient the decrease in TA ranged between 17%-37% respectively, in the second patient between 63%-76% and in the third patient between 70-100% for 24-72 h respectively. The current study indicates that a combination of bortezomib and rapamycin, (an m-Tor pathway inhibitor used in MCL treatment) induced synergistic inhibition of telomerase activity. In HBL-2 cells, the combined treatment of bortezomib and rapamycin decreased TA by 80% compared to the expected value (40%) and for NCEB cells a similar trend was observed. In contrast, there was neither additive nor synergistic effect of this combination on cell proliferation. In the light of the crucial role of telomerase in cancer cells, it was important to characterize the possible relations between telomerase and bortezomib and to distinguish the biochemical mechanisms of its regulation and its interactions with other signal transduction inhibitors such as rapamycin. The results of this work encourage the in vivo examination of the therapeutic potential of the combination of bortezomib and rapamycin in Mantle Cell Lymphoma patients .", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25500084/"}

To estimate the impact of therapy on hip fractures, costs, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), the analysis included women>or=65 years, treated with risedronate or alendronate and followed for 4 additional years. Country-specific data included population mortality, fracture costs, and annual drug costs, using a German social insurance perspective. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. A differential hip fracture relative risk reduction of 43% was applied to risedronate vs. alendronate. ### results The model predicted that treatment with risedronate would result in fewer hip fractures and more QALYs at a reduced cost (savings of euro278 per treated woman) compared to treatment with generic alendronate. Sensitivity analysis assuming 2 years of treatment and equivalence of effect after 1 year show cost savings as well (euro106 per treated woman). ### discussion Whereas previous economic evaluations involving bisphosphonates have mainly relied on efficacy data from noncomparative clinical trials, this study's strength is in the use of comparative effectiveness data from one data source. The magnitude of the cost savings observed were sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding treatment duration, therapy discontinuation and cost of generic alendronate. ### conclusions Based on \"real world\" data the analysis supports the first line use of risedronate for the treatment of osteoporotic women in Germany.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883401/"}

Preoperative infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and concurrent radiation therapy (RT) followed by total mesorectal surgery is the current standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer (LAR). When compared with postoperative 5-FU-based chemoradiation, this strategy is associated with significantly lower rates of local relapse, lower toxicity and better compliance. capecitabine is a rationally designed oral prodrug that is converted into 5-FU by intracellular thymidine phosphorylase. Substitution of infusional 5-FU with capecitabine is an attractive option that provides a more convenient administration schedule and, possibly, increased efficacy. Indeed, incorporation of capecitabine in combined modality neoadjuvant therapy for LAR has been under intense investigation during the last 10 years. Phase I and II clinical trials showed that a regimen consisting of capecitabine 825mg/m(2) twice daily for 7 days/week continuous oral administration in combination with RT is an active and well tolerated regimen, thereby being the preferred concurrent regimen. The definitive demonstration that efficacy of capecitabine/RT is similar to 5-FU/RT has been provided by the NSABP-R-04 and the German Margit trials. One approach to improve outcomes in rectal cancer is to deliver a second RT-sensitizing drug with effective systemic activity. oxaliplatin and irinotecan are therefore good candidates. However , two phase III trials demonstrated that incorporation of oxaliplatin to capecitabine with RT did not improve early outcomes and , by contrast , increased toxicity . capecitabine has also been combined with irinotecan. This regimen showed encouraging results in phase I and II clinical trials, which led to an ongoing phase III clinical trial. New strategies with induction chemotherapy with or without chemoradiation prior to surgery are currently under investigation. Whether or not capecitabine has a role in this setting is being investigated in ongoing trials. Incorporation of agents directed towards new targets, such as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies or antiangiogenic agents, in combination preoperative regimens, is being hampered by results of early trials in which efficacy outcomes with cetuximab were poor and an excessive rate of surgical complications with bevacizumab was observed. The lack of improvements in efficacy with the addition of cetuximab or bevacizumab in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer led to concerns about further development of these agents in rectal cancer. The role of capecitabine in the postoperative adjuvant setting is the aim of the ongoing Dutch SCRIPT trial. The prediction of response associated with capecitabine has been based on expression of thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, as well as on gene expression arrays. All these procedures require further validation and should be considered as investigational. In conclusion, capecitabine can safely and effectively replace intravenous continuous infusion of 5-FU in the preoperative chemoradiation setting for rectal cancer management. The addition of other new antineoplastic agents to a fluoropyrimidine-based regimen remains investigational.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22621694/"}

Nevertheless, the adoption of lipid rescue therapy by Chinese practitioners remains unknown. We, therefore, evaluated the current approaches to treat LAST and the use of lipid rescue therapy among anesthesiologists in China. ### methods In September 2013, a 23-question survey on regional anesthesia practice and availability of lipid emulsions was sent by e-mail to directors or designated individuals at 41 academic anesthesiology departments listed by the orthopedic anesthesia group of the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology. ### results Responses were received from 36 of the 41 (88 %) anesthesiology departments. To simplify the analysis, responses were divided into two groups according to the annual percentage of patients who received regional anesthesia (RA) for orthopedic anesthesia: 14 departments (39%) with high-utilization (\u2265 50%) and 22 departments (61%) low-utilization (<50%) of RA. Ropivacaine and bupivacaine were the common drugs used for RA , which were independent of RA utilization . Interestingly, ultrasound-guided techniques were much more frequently used in low-utilization institutions than in high-utilization institutions (P = 0.025). Lipid emulsion was readily available in 8 of the 36 (22%) responding institutions, with 7 of the other 28 (25%) institutions planning to stock lipid emulsion. No differences in lipid availability and storage plans were observed between high- and low-utilization institutions. Lipid resuscitation was performed in five of the eight departments that had lipid emulsion.

The study that used licensed ranibizumab had a unique design compared with the other studies in that included eyes had persisting DMO after anti-VEGF monotherapy and received three monthly doses of ranibizumab prior to allocation. The anti-VEGF agent was combined with intravitreal triamcinolone in six studies and with an intravitreal dexamethasone implant in two studies. The comparator group was anti-VEGF alone in all studies; two studies had an additional steroid monotherapy arm, another study had an additional macular laser photocoagulation arm. Whilst we judged these studies to be at low risk of bias for most domains, at least one domain was at unclear risk in all studies.When comparing anti-VEGF/steroid with anti-VEGF monotherapy as primary therapy for DMO, we found no meaningful clinical difference in change in BCVA (mean difference (MD) -2.29 visual acuity (VA) letters, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.03 to 1.45; 3 RCTs; 188 eyes; low-certainty evidence) or change in CMT (MD 0.20 \u03bcm, 95% CI -37.14 to 37.53; 3 RCTs; 188 eyes; low-certainty evidence) at one year. There was very low-certainty evidence on intraocular inflammation from 8 studies, with one event in the anti-VEGF/steroid group (313 eyes) and two events in the anti-VEGF group (322 eyes). There was a greater risk of raised IOP (Peto odds ratio (OR) 8.13, 95% CI 4.67 to 14.16; 635 eyes; 8 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) and development of cataract (Peto OR 7.49, 95% CI 2.87 to 19.60; 635 eyes; 8 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) in eyes receiving anti-VEGF/steroid compared with anti-VEGF monotherapy. There was low-certainty evidence from one study of an increased risk of systemic adverse events in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the anti-VEGF alone group (Peto OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.86; 103 eyes).One study compared anti-VEGF/steroid versus macular laser therapy. At one year investigators did not report a meaningful difference between the groups in change in BCVA (MD 4.00 VA letters 95% CI -2.70 to 10.70; 80 eyes; low-certainty evidence) or change in CMT (MD -16.00 \u03bcm, 95% CI -68.93 to 36.93; 80 eyes; low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence suggesting an increased risk of cataract in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the macular laser group (Peto OR 4.58, 95% 0.99 to 21.10, 100 eyes) and an increased risk of elevated IOP in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the macular laser group (Peto OR 9.49, 95% CI 2.86 to 31.51; 100 eyes).One study provided very low-certainty evidence comparing anti-VEGF/steroid versus steroid monotherapy at one year. There was no evidence of a meaningful difference in BCVA between treatments at one year (MD 0 VA letters, 95% CI -6.1 to 6.1, low-certainty evidence). Likewise, there was no meaningful difference in the mean CMT at one year (MD - 9 \u03bcm, 95% CI -39.87\u03bcm to 21.87\u03bcm between the anti-VEGF/steroid group and the steroid group. There was very low-certainty evidence on raised IOP at one year comparing the anti-VEGF/steroid versus steroid groups (Peto OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.55).No included study reported impact of treatment on patients' quality of life or economic data. None of the studies reported any cases of endophthalmitis. ### Authors Conclusions Combination of intravitreal anti-VEGF plus intravitreal steroids does not appear to offer additional visual benefit compared with monotherapy for DMO; at present the evidence for this is of low-certainty. There was an increased rate of cataract development and raised intraocular pressure in eyes treated with anti-VEGF plus steroid versus anti-VEGF alone. Patients were exposed to potential side effects of both these agents without reported additional benefit. The majority of the evidence comes from studies of bevacizumab and triamcinolone used as primary therapy for DMO . There is limited evidence from studies using licensed intravitreal anti-VEGF agents plus licensed intravitreal steroid implants with at least one year follow-up. It is not known whether treatment response is different in eyes that are phakic and pseudophakic at baseline.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29669176/"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were eligible. Sequential and concurrent schedules were studied.  RESULTS: Forty-three patients were studied in 9 different dose levels (6 sequential and 3 concurrent). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on the sequential schedule was decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and vorinostat 200 mg three times a day on days 6-12.

The promising clinical activity of docetaxel has also promoted considerable interest in combining this drug with other antitumor agents. In this study, we assessed the cytotoxic interaction between docetaxel and doxorubicin administered at various schedules to human breast and ovarian cancer cells. Through a series of in vitro assays including DNA fragmentation analyses, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, and flow cytometric analyses, we found that the antagonistic interaction occurred when tumor cells were exposed to the two drugs simultaneously or exposed to doxorubicin before docetaxel. However, no antagonism was observed when docetaxel was added before doxorubicin. Further analyses demonstrated that doxorubicin could interfere with the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel on both mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death. In addition , biochemical examinations revealed that docetaxel could induce phosphorylation of both bcl-2 and c-raf-1 , but these changes were inhibited when tumor cells were pretreated or simultaneously treated with doxorubicin . These results indicate that the interaction between docetaxel and doxorubicin is highly schedule dependent. Exposure of tumor cells to doxorubicin before docetaxel could result in pronounced antagonism. The optimal schedule for this combination might be sequential exposure to docetaxel followed by doxorubicin.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10999771/"}

To determine if fluorouracil (5-FU) plus high-dose leucovorin (LV) enhances local response in patients receiving preoperative radiation therapy (RT) for adenocarcinoma of the rectum, we compared the degree of downstaging in patients receiving preoperative RT with or without chemotherapy. ### Patients And Methods For this comparison, three groups of patients who were treated with identical doses and techniques of preoperative pelvic RT (total dose of 5,040 cGy) were examined. Group 1 included 20 patients with unresectable disease who received combined RT and LV/5-FU. Group 2 included 11 patients with unresectable disease who received preoperative RT. Group 3 included 21 patients with invasive, resectable, primary disease who received preoperative RT. ### results Patients with unresectable disease who received LV/5-FU had a higher rate of pathologic complete response (20% v 0%) and a lower incidence of positive nodes (30% v 64%) compared with those who did not receive chemotherapy. Even when the most favorable group of patients was included (group 3), patients who received LV/5-FU still had a higher complete response rate (20% v 6%) and a lower incidence of positive nodes (30% v 53%) compared with those who received RT without LV/5-FU. Of those patients with initially unresectable disease, the resectability rate was higher in those who received LV/5-FU compared with those who did not receive LV/5-FU (90% v 64%). Patients who received LV/5-FU experienced slightly more grade 1 to 2 fatigue, stomatitis, nausea, and grade 3 diarrhea, tenesmus, and dysuria. ### conclusions Despite the fact that patients who received chemotherapy (group 1) had more advanced disease compared with those with resectable disease (group 3), the addition of LV/5-FU increased the resectability and downstaging rates. The ultimate impact of a complete response as well as a decrease in the incidence of pelvic nodes on local control and survival remains to be determined. However, given the enhancement of down-staging in patients with unresectable rectal cancer, we are encouraged by the combined modality approach.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1727928/"}

This is the final analysis of a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled phase II study that investigated the long-term efficacy and safety in treatment-naive Japanese patients with advanced melanoma, including acral or mucosal subtypes, and subsequent therapy after discontinuation of the investigational agents. Patients received four doses of nivolumab (1\u00a0mg/kg i.v.) in combination with ipilimumab (3\u00a0mg/kg i.v.) at 3-week intervals, followed by doses of nivolumab (3\u00a0mg/kg i.v.) at 2-week intervals. The median follow-up period was 20.8\u00a0months (range, 5.2-35.0). The centrally and locally assessed objective response rates were both 43.3% (13/30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.5-62.6).

To analyse the cost-effectiveness of traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) compared to biological therapies from the perspective of Chinese society. ### Methodology Principal Findings A mathematical model was developed by incorporating the clinical trial data and Chinese unit costs and treatment sequences from a lifetime perspective. Hypothetical cohorts with moderate to severe RA were simulated. The primary outcome measure-quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)-was derived from disease severity (HAQ scores). Primary analysis included drug costs, monitoring costs, and other costs. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Treatment sequences that included TNF antagonists and rituximab produced a greater number of QALYs than tDMARDs alone or TNF antagonists plus DMARDs. In comparison with tDMARDs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab without rituximab were $77,357.7, $26,562.4 and $57,838.4 per QALY and $66,422.9, $28,780.6 and $50,937.6 per QALY, for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab with rituximab. No biotherapy was cost-effective under the willingness to pay threshold when the threshold was 3 times the per capita GDP of China. When 3 times the per capita GDP of Shanghai used as the threshold, infliximab and rituximab could yield nearly 90% cost-effective simulations in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. ### Conclusions Significance tDMARD was the most cost-effective option in the Chinese healthcare setting.

In vitro studies reported here showed verapamil sensitization of Adriamycin resistance in 18.8% of fresh human breast cancer specimens tested. Patients (27) were first treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin and dexamethasone (CVAD) alone. Verapamil and quinine were added in patients with tumors failing to respond or progressing on CVAD alone . Following treatment with CVAD alone there were no complete remissions and 3 patients (11%) developed partial remissions lasting 5.5, 8, 10.5 months. With the addition of verapamil and quinine to the CVAD regimen, one patient (4%) developed a complete remission of 11.8 months duration and 4 additional patients (15%) developed partial remissions lasting 2.8, 17.3, 19 and > 40 months.

Resistance to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly higher in toxigenic strains than non-toxigenic strains (p<0.01), whereas kanamycin and erythromycin resistance was significantly higher in non-toxigenic strains (p<0.01 and <0.05, respectively). Resistance to two or more antimicrobials was observed in 85.5% (177/207) of total strains, with a significantly higher occurrence in toxigenic strains (89.3%, 134/150 vs. 75.4%, 43/57; p<0.05).", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19498301/"}

We compared the responses of the stress hormones, cortisol, ACTH, vasopressin (AVP), corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and catecholamines to elective conventional and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ### design A right upper quadrant transverse incision was used for conventional cholecystectomy, and four 1-2-cm incisions for the laparoscopic procedure (for insertion of surgical instruments, diathermy, fibreoptic telescope and light source, and carbon dioxide insufflation). Blood was sampled immediately prior to premedication ( temazepam ) , after induction of anaesthesia ( fentanyl and thiopentone ) and at 10-minute intervals until the end of the procedure ( N2O maintenance , vecuronium relaxation ) . A blood sample was taken after reversal, and then at 10-minute intervals for 50 minutes. Plasma sodium and blood pressure were measured at similar intervals. Results are expressed as mean +/- standard error. ### patients Twelve patients were studied (six in each group). ### measurements Peptide hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay, cortisol by ELISA and catecholamines by HPLC. ### results The mean premedication hormone values for the conventional and laparoscopic procedures did not increase significantly after induction of anaesthesia. Within 10 minutes of the first incision, however, there was a marked concordant rise in mean plasma ACTH and AVP levels for both procedures (conventional: ACTH, from a premedication value of 10.2 +/- 1.7 to 80.1 +/- 14.3 pmol/l, AVP from 1.2 +/- 0.4 to 117 +/- 24 pmol/l, P < 0.01 for both hormones; laparoscopic: ACTH from 5.8 +/- 2.6 to 55.1 +/- 26.0 pmol/l, AVP from 1.6 +/- 0.11 to 49.2 +/- 27.09 pmol/l). At the end of both types of operation mean levels of ACTH and AVP were still elevated, although the ACTH: AVP ratio had increased. Greater variability in ACTH and AVP responses was seen in the laparoscopic than in the conventional procedure, three patients showing a relatively small response to surgery. Total secretion of ACTH during both types of surgery was not significantly less both during (P < 0.05), and after (P < 0.01) laparoscopic surgery. For both procedures, the timing of AVP and ACTH peaks was significantly related (P < 0.002). A small but significant rise in CRH was observed 30 minutes after the start of surgery for both procedures P < 0.05). The timing of CRH and ACTH peaks was unrelated. The maximum mean plasma cortisol level for the conventional procedure (1268 +/- 147 nmol/l) was reached 20 minutes after reversal of anaesthesia and remained at this level until the end of sampling. The cortisol response was comparable during the laparoscopic procedure but was beginning to fall at 60 minutes post-operatively. Plasma adrenaline responses to the two types of surgery were not significantly different, but the plasma total noradrenaline response to laparoscopic surgery as indicated by the response area during the first 20 minutes was significantly increased (P < 0.02). Plasma sodium, renin activity and initial systolic blood pressure fall were not significantly different during the two procedures. ### conclusions For both procedures, the peak of ACTH secretion after incision is likely to be AVP dependent, and the timing of peak levels of these two hormones was significantly related. Subsequent ACTH secretion may be the result of an interaction between AVP and CRH. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in a smaller AVP rise than does the conventional procedure, and plasma AVP falls more rapidly post-operatively. During the period of observation, ACTH, CRH, cortisol and adrenaline responses were not significantly lessened by the laparoscopic approach, but there was a significant increase in the noradrenaline response.

Most beta2-mimetics with a rapid onset of effect act for 4 to 6 hours. Inhalatory beta2-mimetics with long-term action ( LABA ) , formoterol and salmeterol , possess a period of action longer than 12 hours . formoterol and salmeterol represent great progress in asthma management, particularly in combination with inhalatory corticosteroids (IKS).

In an approach to improve the pharmacological properties, safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, and their penetration into HIV reservoirs or sanctuaries, and consequently, the therapeutic potential of the current protease inhibitors (PIs) used in clinics, we investigated the synthesis of various mannose-substituted saquinavir, nelfinavir, and indinavir prodrugs, their in vitro stability with respect to hydrolysis, anti-HIV activity, cytotoxicity, and permeation through a monolayer of Caco-2 cells used as a model of the intestinal barrier. Mannose-derived conjugates were prepared in two steps, in good yields, by condensing an acid derivative of a protected mannose with the PIs, followed by deprotection of the sugar protecting group. With respect to hydrolysis, these PI prodrugs are chemically stable with half-life times in the 50-60 h range that are compatible with an in vivo utilization aimed at improving the absorption/penetration or accumulation of the prodrug in specific cells/tissues and liberation of the active free drug inside HIV-infected cells. These stabilities correlate closely with the low in vitro anti-HIV activity measured for those prodrugs wherein the coupling of mannose to the PIs was performed through the peptidomimetic PI's hydroxyl. Importantly, mannose conjugation to the PIs was further found to improve the absorptive transepithelial transport of saquinavir and indinavir but not of nelfinavir across Caco-2 cell monolayers, by contrast to glucose conjugation which had the opposite effect. The mannose-linked prodrugs of saquinavir and indinavir display therefore a most promising therapeutic potential provided that bioavailability , penetration into the HIV infected macrophages , and HIV-reservoirs of these PIs are improved .", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17105238/"}

Resistant isolates emerged quickly and uniformly in all patients administered nevirapine either as monotherapy or in combination with zidovudine ( AZT ) .

The randomised phase 3 TURANDOT trial compared two approved bevacizumab-containing regimens for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in terms of efficacy, safety, and quality of life. The interim analysis did not confirm non-inferior overall survival (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b704; 97\u00b75% repeated CI [RCI] -\u221e to 1\u00b769). Here we report final results of our study aiming to show non-inferior overall survival with first-line bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. ### methods In this multinational, open-label, randomised phase 3 TURANDOT trial, patients aged 18 years or older who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2 and measurable or non-measurable HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had received no previous chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were stratified and randomly assigned (1:1) using permuted blocks of size six to either bevacizumab plus paclitaxel (bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks) or bevacizumab plus capecitabine (bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on day 1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 every 3 weeks) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Stratification factors were oestrogen or progesterone receptor status, country, and menopausal status. The primary objective was to show non-inferior overall survival with bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel in the per-protocol population by rejecting the null hypothesis of inferiority (HR \u22651\u00b733) using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00600340. ### findings Between Sept 10, 2008, and Aug 30, 2010, 564 patients were randomised, representing the intent-to-treat population. The per-protocol population comprised 531 patients (266 in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group and 265 in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group). At the final overall survival analysis after 183 deaths (69%) in 266 patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and 201 (76%) in 265 receiving bevacizumab plus capecitabine in the per-protocol population, median overall survival was 30\u00b72 months (95% CI 25\u00b76-32\u00b76 months) versus 26\u00b71 months (22\u00b73-29\u00b70), respectively. The stratified HR was 1\u00b702 (97\u00b75% RCI -\u221e to 1\u00b726; repeated p=0\u00b70070), indicating non-inferiority. The unstratified Cox model (HR 1\u00b713 [97\u00b75% RCI -\u221e to 1\u00b739]; repeated p=0\u00b7061) did not support the primary analysis. Intent-to-treat analyses were consistent with the per-protocol results. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (54 [19%] of 284 patients in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group vs 5 [2%] of 277 patients in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group), hand-foot syndrome (1 [<1%] vs 43 [16%]), peripheral neuropathy (39 [14%] vs 1 [<1%]), leucopenia (20 [7%] vs 1 [<1%]), and hypertension (12 [4%] vs 16 [6%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 65 (23%) of 284 patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and 68 (25%) of 277 receiving bevacizumab plus capecitabine. Deaths in two (1%) of 284 patients in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group were deemed by the investigator to be treatment-related. No treatment-related deaths occurred in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group. ### interpretation bevacizumab plus capecitabine represents a valid first-line treatment option for HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, offering good tolerability without compromising overall survival compared with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel. Although progression-free survival with the bevacizumab plus capecitabine combination is inferior to that noted with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel, we suggest that physicians should consider possible predictive risk factors for overall survival, individual's treatment priorities, and the differing safety profiles. ### funding Roche.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27501767/"}

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity. ### objective To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone. ### Design Setting And Participants Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012. ### interventions Cephalexin , 500 mg 4 times daily , plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily , for 7 days ( n = 248 participants ) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days ( n = 248 participants ) . ### Main Outcomes And Measures The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%. ### results Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly. ### Conclusions And Relevance Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed. ### Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00729937.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535235/"}

Triple-negative patients may achieve early responses to anthracyclines and taxanes, but novel strategies are also eagerly sought. The epothilone B analog ixabepilone acts to stabilize microtubules and demonstrates antitumor activity in recent breast cancer studies. Herein, we have analyzed efficacy and safety data of ixabepilone specifically for the treatment of women with triple-negative disease. A retrospective analysis was completed using activity and toxicity data in the triple-negative subsets from 5 phase II studies. In addition, a prospective pooled analysis of triple-negative patients from 2 phase III trials is also reviewed. Of 2,261 patients evaluated in these trials, 556 (24.5%) had triple-negative tumors. In the neoadjuvant setting, ixabepilone produced a pathologic complete response rate in the breast of 26% in triple-negative patients (vs. 15% in the non-triple-negative population). In patients with metastatic breast cancer whose pretreatment status ranged from no prior therapy to progression on several classes of agents, overall response rates (ORR) in the phase II ixabepilone monotherapy trials ranged from 6 to 55%, comparable to rates seen in patients with non-triple-negative tumors. The combination of ixabepilone and capecitabine in the phase II study resulted in an ORR of 23 % in triple-negative patients .

No increase in toxicity was noted in the triple-negative subgroup compared with other patients. ixabepilone shows notable antitumor activity in patients with triple-negative breast cancer when used in a variety of settings.

The standard of care and novel treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are reviewed. ### summary Recent advances in the treatment of CLL have dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape for both patients and health care professionals. The majority of conventional first-line therapies are noncurative and are only used to treat disease that is symptomatic or progressive and include chlorambucil, monotherapy with purine analogues, and combination chemotherapy. Immunotherapeutic agents such as rituximab and alemtuzumab may be indicated in select patient populations. However, because clinical trials have found that overall survival does not depend on the initial therapy, selection of first-line therapy should be based on patient-specific factors and the patient's goals for therapy with respect to response, survival, and symptom palliation. Progression-free survival time and time to treatment are critical endpoints for CLL treatment. An increasingly important endpoint is minimal residual disease (MRD), as it is considered to be the major cause of relapse in CLL. Finally, comparison of toxicities between different therapies is critical in CLL, as it is in other disease states. Several new agents are currently being evaluated for use in CLL, including alvocidib, oblimersen, and lumiliximab. ### conclusion Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients with CLL. The introduction of rituximab , alemtuzumab , and bendamustine has improved the current outlook for patients with CLL . As overall survival does not appear to depend on the initial therapy, treatment should be selected based on patient-specific factors and goals. Challenges in CLL include determining when to initiate therapy, eradicating MRD, and managing therapeutic resistance.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20966144/"}

Fibrosing, non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (non-IPF) interstitial lung diseases (fILDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by a different amount of inflammation and fibrosis. Therapy is currently based on corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators. However, response to these therapies is highly variable, sometimes without meaningful improvement, especially in more fibrosing forms. pirfenidone and nintedanib have recently demonstrated to reduce functional decline in patients with IPF. However, their antifibrotic mechanism makes these two drugs an interesting approach for treatment of fibrosing ILDs other than IPF. ### objectives We here report our experience with antifibrotic drugs in fibrosing non-IPF ILDs patients having a progressive phenotype during immunosuppressive therapy. ### methods Patients with a multidisciplinary team diagnosis of fibrosing non-IPF ILDs experiencing a progressive phenotype during treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators between October-2014 and January-2018 at our tertiary referral Center for ILDs were retrospectively analyzed. Antifibrotic therapy was administered after application with the respective health insurance company and after consent by the patient.

Treatment before antifibrotics consisted of corticosteroids in all patients: 5 combined with Azathioprin, 1 with either methotrexate or cyclophosphamide (i.v.). Ten patients were treated with pirfenidone ( 2403 mg/die ) and 1 with nintedanib (300\u2009mg/die).

The model compared tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day (BID) either as monotherapy or in combination with MTX with similarly labeled biologic therapies. Response to treatment was modeled as American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 response. ACR20 represented clinical response and determined whether patients continued therapy. ACR response rates at 6-month intervals were sourced from prescribing information and safety event rates from a published meta-analysis. Following an adverse event or a lack of response to treatment, it was assumed that 75% of patients switched to the next line of treatment (first to abatacept and then to rituximab). The perspective was that of a U.S. payer. Costs were reported in 2015 U.S. dollars and included drug wholesale acquisition costs, monitoring, drug administration, and treatment for minor and serious adverse events. The patient population eligible for treatment was based on the total number of members (i.e., RA and non-RA) in a payer organization; members with RA treated with biologic therapies were estimated using epidemiological data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of varying key parameters, including treatment-switching probability, product rebate, major rates of adverse drug reaction, and ACR20 rates, on the model outcomes. ### results tofacitinib combination therapy after MTX failure was associated with the lowest cost per member per month (PMPM) over a 2-year time frame at $5.53, compared with $6.49 for adalimumab, $6.43 for etanercept, $5.95 for certolizumab, and $5.89 for tocilizumab. Similar savings were observed when all biologics were administered as monotherapy. Tofacitinib combination therapy was also associated with the lower PMPM cost compared with adalimumab combination therapy in the TNF-IR analysis . tofacitinib was also among the lowest cost per ACR20 responder in each analysis. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that tofacitinib would potentially be cost saving even in the least optimistic scenarios. ### conclusions This analysis suggests that tofacitinib 5 mg BID following MTX failure is a lower cost per patient treatment option when used either as monotherapy or combination therapy, compared with adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab and tocilizumab biologic regimens. tofacitinib + MTX in TNF-IR patients was also predicted to be a lower-cost treatment option compared with adalimumab+MTX and was associated with the lowest cost per ACR 20/50/70 responder. ### disclosures This study was funded by Pfizer, which determined the research topic and paid York Health Economics Consortium to develop the analysis and conduct the research.

And the mechanism is also not fully clear yet. ### methods A cross-sectional research was performed and 130 subjects with dyslipidemia and overweight/obese were enrolled and randomly assigned into combined group (20\u2009mg of atorvastatin daily plus 500\u2009mg of metformin twice daily) and control group (20\u2009mg of atorvastatin daily). At baseline and 8 weeks later, parameters of interest were recorded and fasting venous blood was drawn for laboratory examination. ### results The rates of overweight (76.9% vs. 73.8%) and obese (23.1% vs. 26.2%) in both group were comparable. Dyslipidemia in both groups were featured by increased serum levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Serum level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) was comparably elevated in both groups at baseline, and leukocyte rho-associated kinase 2 (ROCK2) and serum nitric oxide (NO) concentrations were also comparable. Generally, the baseline characteristics between these 2 groups were no significant differences. 8 weeks later, compared to baseline, body mass index (BMI), the rates of overweight and obese, daily exercise time, smoking status, lipid profiles, Hs-CRP level, leukocyte ROCK2 and serum NO concentrations in both groups were improved. Notably, compared to control group, the rate of obese, Hs-CRP level, leukocyte ROCK2 and serum NO concentrations were improved more profoundly in the combined group (p<0.05). After adjusted for age, gender, BMI, TG, LDL-C, Hs-CRP and exercise time, atorvastatin plus metformin was positively associated with serum NO concentration, with odds ratio (OR) of 1.146 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.089-1.164, combined group vs. control group, p<0.05), and inversely associated with leukocyte ROCK2 concentration, with OR of 0.853 (95% CI 0.834-0.872, combined group vs. control group, p<0.05). ### conclusion In subjects with dyslipidemia and overweight/obese, atorvastatin plus metformin may confer additive benefits through reducing leukocyte ROCK2 concentration.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27123784/"}

Among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosed in the United States, 37.2% are diagnosed with stage III and 27.9% with stage II disease. In locoregionally advanced CRC, surgery is the primary treatment modality and has a curative intent. The survival depends on the pathologic stage and varies from 30%-60% for stage III to 60%-80% for stage II. However, as much as 40%-50% of patients will relapse and require additional treatment of the disease. Clinical failure after resection of CRC is predominantly secondary to the clinical progression of previously undetected distant metastatic disease. Until very recently, the absolute benefit for survival obtained with adjuvant therapy compared with control was about 6%. Introduction of oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting has shown a reduction of 23% in the risk of relapse when compared with 5-fluorouracil alone (MOSAIC). Recent phase III studies have shown that targeted agents improved survival in patients with advanced-stage CRC. Bevacizumab , a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor , is the first antiangiogenic drug to show improved efficacy when used in combination with irinotecan and oxaliplatin for first- and second-line treatment of CRC . cetuximab, another monoclonal antibody targeting epidermal growth factor receptor, has shown efficacy in third-line therapy and promising results in first-line phase II studies.

The exploratory analysis with extended follow-up reported here aims to assess long-term efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib monotherapy in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. ### methods In the ongoing, randomised, open-label, phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 study, adults (\u226518 years old) with treatment-naive, advanced renal cell carcinoma with clear cell histology were enrolled in 129 sites (hospitals and cancer centres) across 16 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles plus 5 mg axitinib orally twice daily or 50 mg sunitinib monotherapy orally once daily for 4 weeks per 6-week cycle.

Isolated rabbit hearts (Langendorff technique) were submitted to increased left ventricular stretch at the left wall by insertion of an additional intraventricular balloon and adjusting the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) to 25 mmHg for 10 min followed by 20 min recovery at normal EDP of 5-8 mmHg.

Without treatment, patients with inoperable or metastatic colorectal cancer have a median life expectancy of about 8 months. The following article is an update of our 2005 review of chemotherapy regimens used in metastatic colorectal cancer, based on the standard Prescrire methodology. In 2005, the de Gramont protocol, based on fluorouracil (always combined with folinic acid) plus either oxaliplatin (Folfox protocol) or irinotecan (Folfiri protocol), was the standard first-line chemotherapy in this setting. Four trials comparing monotherapy versus combination therapy in previously untreated patients showed that initial fluorouracil (or fluorouracil precursor) monotherapy, followed by the Folfox or Folfiri protocol in case of failure, was not associated with shorter overall survival. Two trials compared first-line treatment with the Folfiri regimen versus the Folfoxiri regimen (fluorouracil + oxaliplatin + irinotecan). One of these studies showed an increase in median survival with the Folfoxiri protocol (24 versus 17 months), but at a cost of greater neurotoxicity. The only tangible advantage of capecitabine and tegafur, two oral fluorouracil precursors, is their convenience of use. pemetrexed was less effective and more toxic than the Folfiri protocol in one trial. bevacizumab and panitumumab have yielded disappointing results in previously untreated patients. Neither of these monoclonal antibodies has yet been shown to improve overall survival. Three trials have assessed the addition of cetuximab to combinations consisting of fluorouracil or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin or irinotecan. In two of these trials, the median survival time of patients whose tumours carried the wild-type KRAS gene was about 3 months longer in the cetuximab arms, although the increase was statistically significant in only one trial. cetuximab had no impact on survival time in the third trial. In two trials , an anti-EGFR antibody ( panitumumab or cetuximab ) reduced median survival when added to bevacizumab in previously untreated patients . When progression occurs after treatment with the Folfiri protocol (or equivalent), a combination of the Folfox protocol and bevacizumab seems to increase median survival time by about 2 months versus Folfox alone, but it is also more toxic. In patients who progress after receiving the fluorouracil + oxaliplatin combination (Folfox) or the fluorouracil+ irinotecan combination (Folfiri), neither panitumumab nor cetuximab has been shown to provide a clinically meaningful increase in overall survival. It remains to be shown whether these drugs are more effective in patients with the wild-type KRAS gene than in patients with KRAS mutations. In early 2010, the standard cytotoxic drugs for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer are fluorouracil (combined with folinic acid), oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Initial combination therapy may be beneficial when the metastases are borderline operable. When the metastases are inoperable and are unlikely to become operable after chemotherapy, it seems best to begin treatment with single-agent fluorouracil (+ folinic acid) or capecitabine. The use of monoclonal antibodies in first-line treatment of patients with colorectal cancer is not justified. Further trials of these drugs are warranted as second-line treatment for patients with KRAS wild-type tumours.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21180382/"}

Combination hormonal therapy, comprising a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa) with an antiandrogen, is widely used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. There is ongoing debate regarding the use of combination hormonal therapy as opposed to LHRHa monotherapy. The pivotal consideration is whether there are adequate benefits with combination hormonal therapy in terms of increased survival and decreased disease progression to outweigh the increased risk of adverse events and additional cost. The most recent meta-analysis by the Prostate Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group indicates a small but statistically significant survival benefit with combination hormonal therapy using nonsteroidal antiandrogens. It is, however, noteworthy that combined conclusions derived from such meta-analyses may not apply across each of the individual antiandrogens. Individual studies have reported differences between antiandrogens in terms of both tolerability and efficacy-for example , bicalutamide has been shown to be better tolerated than flutamide , and may be associated with improved survival . In addition, it is essential that treatment decisions are taken in consultation with the patient. Owing to an increasing proportion of cases presenting with early-stage disease, combination hormonal therapy is increasingly used in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting with radiotherapy and, in cases of prostate-specific antigen recurrence after prior localised therapy. Further data are awaited to optimise the use of combination hormonal therapy in these new settings.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15365575/"}

Hepatitis C virus infection affects around 3% of the world population or approximately 160 million people. A variable proportion (5% to 40%) of the infected people develop clinical symptoms. Hence, hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality with hepatic fibrosis, end-stage liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma as the dominant clinical sequelae. Combination therapy with pegylated (peg) interferon-alpha and ribavirin achieves sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment) in approximately 40% to 80% of treated patients, depending on viral genotype. Recently, a new class of drugs have emerged for hepatitis C infection, the direct acting antivirals, which in combination with standard therapy or alone can lead to sustained virological response in 80% or more of treated patients. Aminoadamantanes, mostly amantadine, are antiviral drugs used for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. We have previously systematically reviewed amantadine versus placebo or no intervention and found no significant effects of the amantadine on all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and on adverse events in patients with hepatitis C. Overall, we did not observe a significant effect of amantadine on sustained virological response. In this review, we systematically review aminoadamantanes versus other antiviral drugs. ### objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of aminoadamantanes versus other antiviral drugs for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection by conducting a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials. ### Search Methods The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (1996 to December 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11 of 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to December 2013), EMBASE (1974 to December 2013), Science Citation Index EXPANDED (1900 to December 2013), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp), Google Scholar, and Eudrapharm up to December 2013. Furthermore, full text searches were conducted until December 2013. ### Selection Criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing aminoadamantanes in participants with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. ### Data Collection And Analysis Two authors independently extracted data. RevMan Analysis was used for statistical analysis of dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Methodological domains were used to assess the risk of systematic errors ('bias'). We used trial sequential analysis to assess risk of random errors ('play of chance'). ### Main Results Six randomised clinical trials with 581 participants with chronic hepatitis C were included. All trials had high risk of bias. The included trials compared amantadine versus other antiviral drugs: ribavirin, mycophenolate mofetil, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma. Standard antiviral therapy (interferon-alpha, interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, or peg interferon alpha) was administered equally to the intervention and the control groups in five trials, depending on when the trial was conducted. Four trials compared amantadine versus ribavirin. There were no deaths or liver-related morbidity in the two intervention groups (0/216 (0%) versus 0/211 (0%); 4 trials; very low quality of the evidence). The lower estimated risk for (serious) adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation with amantadine was imprecise (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.16; based on 10/216 (5%) versus 18/211 (9%) participants in 4 trials; very low quality of the evidence). There were more participants with failure of sustained virological response in the amantadine group than in the ribavirin group (206/216 (96%) versus 176/211 (84%); RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22, 4 trials; low quality of the evidence). amantadine versus ribavirin more often failed to achieve end-of follow-up biochemical response (41/46 (89%) versus 31/46 (67%); RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.63; 2 trials; very low quality of the evidence). One trial compared amantadine versus mycophenolate mofetil. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups , except that amantadine was inferior to mycophenolate mofetil regarding the outcome failure to achieve end-of treatment virological response ( low quality of evidence ) . One trial each compared amantadine versus interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma. Both comparisons showed no significant differences in the treatment outcomes (very low quality of the evidence). The observed effects could be due to real effects, systematic errors (bias), or random errors (play of chance). This possible influence on the observed effect by play of chance is due to the fact that trial sequential analyses could not confirm our findings. We were not able to perform meta-analyses on failure of histological improvement and quality of life due to lack of valid data in all trial comparisons. ### Authors Conclusions This systematic review has identified evidence of very low quality for the key outcomes of all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and adverse events in people with chronic hepatitis C when treated with amantadine compared with ribavirin, mycophenolate, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma. The timeframe for measuring the composite outcome was insufficient in the included trials. There was low quality evidence that amantadine led to more participants who failed to achieve sustained virological response compared with ribavirin. This observation may be real or caused by systematic errors (bias), but it does not seem to be caused by random error (play of chance). Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are unable to determine definitively whether amantadine is less effective than other antivirals in patients with chronic hepatitis C. As it appears less likely that future trials assessing amantadine or potentially other aminoadamantanes for patients with chronic hepatitis C would show strong benefits, it is probably better to focus on the assessments of other direct acting antiviral drugs. We found no evidence assessing other aminoadamantanes in randomised clinical trials in order to recommend or refute their use.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24937404/"}

We have previously shown that morning administration of dexamethasone in combination with food induces a doubling of serum leptin levels starting at 7 hours after dexamethasone administration, with a maximum effect at 10 hours, the latest time point that we have studied. However, dexamethasone given in the absence of food had no effect on serum leptin at 10 hours. The present experiment was undertaken to determine the duration of the effect of dexamethasone on 24-hour serum leptin under fasted and fed conditions in humans. ### Research Methods And Procedures Six healthy non-obese male volunteers were studied under the following four conditions: 1) dexamethasone (2 mg intravenously, given at 0900 hours) with fasting; 2) dexamethasone with food (1,700 kcal, 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 30% fat, given in one meal 2 hours after dexamethasone administration at 1100 hours); 3) saline with food (same meal); 4) saline with fasting. Serum leptin, glucose, insulin, and cortisol were monitored every 30 minutes for 24 hours. ### results 1) Under the fasting condition, dexamethasone increased leptin nocturnal secretion between 2100 and 2400 hours. 2) A single meal (1,700 kcal) at 1100 hours increased nocturnal leptin secretion when compared with the fasting condition. The peak increase of leptin was 123% over baseline between 2100 and 2400 hours, 10 to 14 hours after the meal. 3) In the fed + dexamethasone condition, leptin levels increased from baseline starting 8 hours after dexamethasone injection, reached a maximum increase of 260% between 2100 and 2400 hours, then decreased thereafter, remaining elevated compared to baseline for 16 hours. There was a correlation between 24-hour leptin secretion and insulin secretion after a single morning meal. ### discussion A single bolus of dexamethasone , given before a single large meal , produces a delayed ( 6-hour ) but long-lasting increase in serum leptin ( over 16 hours ) . Under fasted conditions, dexamethasone does not increase daytime leptin but does increase leptin during the night.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11068953/"}

Systemic treatment with physostigmine , an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase , modestly reduced the acquisition and rate of heroin self-administration , and this suppression of heroin intake was reversed by pretreatment with scopolamine but not by mecamylamine . Following 10-14 days of self-administration, rats were left in the home environment for 14 days. Subsequently, rats were evaluated for extinction of nose-pokes during the first hour after being returned to the self-administration apparatus. One hour later a conditioned stimulus (house light, light in the nose-poke hole, sound of the infusion pump) was presented to initiate cue-induced reinstatement. Physostigmine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of cue-induced reinstatement, but only the dose of 0.5 mg/kg significantly decreased nose-poke responding in the extinction test. Chronic treatment with physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) did not impair performance during acquisition of heroin self-administration. However, during a subsequent reinstatement test conducted in the absence of physostigmine pretreatment, heroin seeking was significantly below that of rats chronically pretreated with saline. To evaluate brain regions mediating the effects of systemic drug treatment on reinstatement, physostigmine was microinjected into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or ventral tegmental area (VTA). Microinjection of physostigmine into the NAc prior to presenting conditioned cues inhibited the reinstatement of heroin-seeking, without affecting extinction responding. In contrast, microinjection of physostigmine into the VTA augmented the reinstatement induced by conditioned cues and extinction responding. Inactivation of either NAc or VTA by microinjecting tetrodotoxin blocked both extinction responding and cue-induced reinstatement. These data demonstrate that cholinergic transmission influences heroin self-administration and reinstatement. Moreover, cue-induced reinstatement was inhibited by physostigmine in the NAc and potentiated by cholinergic stimulation in the VTA.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17184925/"}

Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) commonly occurs in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with PVTT usually have an aggressive disease course, decreased liver function reserve, limited treatment options, higher recurrence rates after treatment, and, therefore, worse overall survival. Among untreated HCC patients with PVTT, the median overall survival has been reported as low as 2 to 4 months. Historically, many aspects of PVTT have impacted the theoretical and practical safety and efficacy of treatment, for example, disordered blood flow and associated impairment of liver function, heat-sink effects of blood flow in the area of the PVTT, and risk of recurrence due to tumor location in the blood vessel. The current Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system categorizes HCC patients with PVTT as advanced stage, for which the standard of care is targeted therapy with sorafenib. However, sorafenib is associated with only marginal benefits among patients with PVTT. First-line lenvatinib , which was shown to be noninferior to sorafenib , excluded patients with main portal trunk invasion . regorafenib and nivolumab, an immune-based therapy, were recently approved in the United States for second-line therapy after sorafenib. Preliminary results for cabozantinib suggest a benefit in the second-/third-line after sorafenib failure. In addition, rapid advances in many fields (surgery, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine, and immunotherapy) have increased the potential treatment options for the management of this complex disease entity. A large portion of the emerging evidence focuses on the broader category of advanced HCC of which PVTT is a subgroup. While many of these studies show promising results, the efficacy among PVTT patients requires validation in prospective studies. Real-world data may help fill the evidence gap for patients not eligible for clinical trials due to common hepatic function requirements. The variety of new treatment advances for the heterogeneous and complex disease entity of HCC with PVTT means that personalized, multidisciplinary management may be necessary to achieve optimal outcomes.

Synaptoneurosomes obtained from the cortex of rat brain prelabeled with [14C]arachidonic acid [( 14C]AA) were used as a source of substrate and enzyme in studies on the regulation of AA release. A significant amount of AA is liberated in the presence of 2 mM EGTA, independently of Ca2+, primarily from phosphatidic acid and polyphosphoinositides (poly-PI). Quinacrine, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), suppressed AA release by about 60% and neomycin, a putative inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC), reduced AA release by about 30%. An additive effect was exhibited when both inhibitors were given together. Ca2+ activated AA release. The level of Ca2+ present in the synaptoneurosomal preparation (endogenous level) and 5 microM CaCl2 enhance AA liberation by approximately 25%, whereas 2 mM CaCl2 resulted in a 50% increase in AA release relative to EGTA. The source for Ca(2+)-dependent AA release is predominantly phosphatidylinositol (PI); however, a small pool may also be liberated from neutral lipids. carbachol, an agonist of the cholinergic receptor, stimulated Ca(2+)-dependent AA release by about 17%. Bradykinin enhanced the effect of carbachol by about 10 - 15 % . This agonist-mediated AA release occurs specifically from phosphoinositides (PI + poly-PI). Quinacrine almost completely suppresses calcium-and carbachol-mediated AA release. neomycin inhibits this process by about 30% and totally suppresses the effect of bradykinin. Our results indicate that both phospholipases PLA2 and PLC with subsequent action of DAG lipase are responsible for Ca(2+)-independent AA release.

Between\u00a0the 2 groups there was no significant difference in urinary symptoms, body pain and activities of daily living from baseline to just before stent removal (p = 0.95, 0.40 and 0.95, respectively). Although there was no difference between the groups, both showed improvement in urinary symptoms from the time of\u00a0initial stent insertion to just prior to stent removal (difference -0.50 for combination therapy and -0.40 for monotherapy). The mean stent indwelling time of 9.6 and 8.7 days in the combination and monotherapy groups, respectively, did not differ (p = 0.67). On ANOVA it had no significant impact on results (p = 0.64). ### conclusions Combination therapy with tamsulosin and tolterodine does not appear to improve urinary symptoms, bodily pain or quality of life in patients after ureteral stent placement for nephrolithiasis compared to tamsulosin alone. Both groups experienced worse urinary symptoms, pain and quality of life with a stent, suggesting that further research is necessary to improve stent discomfort.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26393904/"}

Cancer is second most common cause of death in the United State. There are over 100 different types of cancer associated with different human organs, predominantly breast, liver, pancreas, prostate, colon, rectum, lung, and stomach. We have recently reported properties of pro-inflammatory (for treatment of various types of cancers), and anti-inflammatory (for cardiovascular disease and diabetes) compounds. The major problem associated with development of anticancer drugs is their lack of solubility in aqueous solutions and severe side effects in cancer patients. Therefore, the present study was carried out to check anticancer properties of selected compounds, mostly aqueous soluble, in cancer cell lines from different organs. ### methods The anticancer properties, anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptotic activity of novel naturally occurring or FDA approved, nontoxic, proteasome inhibitors/activators were compared. In addition to that, effect of \u03b4-tocotrienol on expression of proteasome subunits (X, Y, Z, LMP7, LMP2, LMP10), ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and TNF-\u03b1 using total RNAs derived from plasmas of hepatitis C patients was investigated. ### results Our data demonstrated that following compounds are very effective in inducing apoptosis of cancer cells: Thiostrepton, dexamethasone, 2-methoxyestradiol, \u03b4-tocotrienol, quercetin, amiloride, and quinine sulfate have significant anti-proliferation properties in Hela cells (44% - 87%) with doses of 2.5-20\u00a0\u03bcM, compared to respective controls.

The optimal dose of gemcitabine that can be used with concurrent radiation therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer has not been well defined. This trial addresses this question in an alternating sequence \"ping-pong\" design trial to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for gemcitabine/carboplatin (Sequence A) or gemcitabine/paclitaxel (Sequence B) and thoracic radiation therapy followed by adjuvant gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy. ### Patients And Methods Thirty-five patients with histologically confirmed Stage IIIA/B non-small cell lung cancer were entered into two separate sequences, each with multiple cohorts. A dose level was considered acceptable if, of the first six eligible patients on each cohort, fewer than three experienced dose limiting toxicities. ### results Sequence B of this 2 sequence \"ping-pong\" trial closed early due to toxicity in cohort 2 (gemcitabine 300 mg/m/wk and paclitaxel 30 mg/m/wk).

Since the mid-2000s, the field of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has experienced a paradigm shift from non-specific therapy with broad-acting cytokines to specific regimens, which directly target the cancer, the tumour microenvironment, or both.Current guidelines recommend targeted therapies with agents such as sunitinib, pazopanib or temsirolimus (for people with poor prognosis) as the standard of care for first-line treatment of people with mRCC and mention non-specific cytokines as an alternative option for selected patients.In November 2015, nivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor directed against programmed death-1 (PD-1), was approved as the first specific immunotherapeutic agent as second-line therapy in previously treated mRCC patients. ### objectives To assess the effects of immunotherapies either alone or in combination with standard targeted therapies for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and their efficacy to maximize patient benefit. ### Search Methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ISI Web of Science and registers of ongoing clinical trials in November 2016 without language restrictions. We scanned reference lists and contacted experts in the field to obtain further information. ### Selection Criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs with or without blinding involving people with mRCC. ### Data Collection And Analysis We collected and analyzed studies according to the published protocol. Summary statistics for the primary endpoints were risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MD) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We rated the quality of evidence using GRADE methodology and summarized the quality and magnitude of relative and absolute effects for each primary outcome in our 'Summary of findings' tables. ### Main Results We identified eight studies with 4732 eligible participants and an additional 13 ongoing studies. We categorized studies into comparisons, all against standard therapy accordingly as first-line (five comparisons) or second-line therapy (one comparison) for mRCC.Interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 monotherapy probably increases one-year overall mortality compared to standard targeted therapies with temsirolimus or sunitinib (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.51; 2 studies; 1166 participants; moderate-quality evidence), may lead to similar quality of life (QoL) (e.g. MD -5.58 points, 95% CI -7.25 to -3.91 for Functional Assessment of Cancer - General (FACT-G); 1 study; 730 participants; low-quality evidence) and may slightly increase the incidence of adverse events (AEs) grade 3 or greater (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32; 1 study; 408 participants; low-quality evidence).There is probably no difference between IFN-\u03b1 plus temsirolimus and temsirolimus alone for one-year overall mortality (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.34; 1 study; 419 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but the incidence of AEs of 3 or greater may be increased (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.45; 1 study; 416 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no information on QoL.IFN-\u03b1 alone may slightly increase one-year overall mortality compared to IFN-\u03b1 plus bevacizumab (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.36; 2 studies; 1381 participants; low-quality evidence). This effect is probably accompanied by a lower incidence of AEs of grade 3 or greater (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84; 2 studies; 1350 participants; moderate-quality evidence). QoL could not be evaluated due to insufficient data. Treatment with IFN-\u03b1 plus bevacizumab or standard targeted therapy ( sunitinib ) may lead to similar one-year overall mortality ( RR 0.37 , 95 % CI 0.13 to 1.08 ; 1 study ; 83 participants ; low-quality evidence ) and AEs of grade 3 or greater ( RR 1.18 , 95 % CI 0.85 to 1.62 ; 1 study ; 82 participants ; low-quality evidence ) . QoL could not be evaluated due to insufficient data.Treatment with vaccines (e.g. MVA-5T4 or IMA901) or standard therapy may lead to similar one-year overall mortality (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.32; low-quality evidence) and AEs of grade 3 or greater (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.39; 2 studies; 1065 participants; low-quality evidence). QoL could not be evaluated due to insufficient data.In previously treated patients, targeted immunotherapy (nivolumab) probably reduces one-year overall mortality compared to standard targeted therapy with everolimus (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.87; 1 study; 821 participants; moderate-quality evidence), probably improves QoL (e.g. RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.78 for clinically relevant improvement of the FACT-Kidney Symptom Index Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS); 1 study, 704 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and probably reduces the incidence of AEs grade 3 or greater (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.65; 1 study; 803 participants; moderate-quality evidence). ### Authors Conclusions Evidence of moderate quality demonstrates that IFN-\u03b1 monotherapy increases mortality compared to standard targeted therapies alone, whereas there is no difference if IFN is combined with standard targeted therapies. Evidence of low quality demonstrates that QoL is worse with IFN alone and that severe AEs are increased with IFN alone or in combination. There is low-quality evidence that IFN-\u03b1 alone increases mortality but moderate-quality evidence on decreased AEs compared to IFN-\u03b1 plus bevacizumab. Low-quality evidence shows no difference for IFN-\u03b1 plus bevacizumab compared to sunitinib with respect to mortality and severe AEs. Low-quality evidence demonstrates no difference of vaccine treatment compared to standard targeted therapies in mortality and AEs, whereas there is moderate-quality evidence that targeted immunotherapies reduce mortality and AEs and improve QoL.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28504837/"}

Our study aimed to analyze the influence of sorafenib and sunitinib on the frequency of Treg in patients with metastatic RCC ( mRCC ) . Treg were analyzed by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood (PB) of patients (n=19) with histologically confirmed mRCC under treatment with either sunitinib (50 mg/d, n=11) or sorafenib (800 mg/d, n=8). Blood samples were taken before treatment and during the first, second, and third months of therapy. Flow cytometric analysis of PB mononuclear cells was performed using fluorochrome-labeled antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD25, and FOXp3. During the first month of therapy, patients treated with sorafenib showed a significant increase in FOXp3CD3CD4CD25 Treg (13.5 vs. 36.3% of gated cells, P=0.02, or 0.35 vs. 0.49% of total cells) and the ratio FOXp3 T cells/FOXp3 T cells (0.16 vs. 0.56 of gated cells, P=0.02). These elevated levels persisted throughout the treatment period. There was no influence of sunitinib on the frequency of Treg in our cohort of patients. sorafenib, but not sunitinib, leads to an early and sustained increase in Treg in PB of mRCC patients. In immunoresponsive tumors such as RCC, immunological effects of kinase inhibitors are particularly relevant for the design of combination trials with immunotherapeutic agents. Our study suggests that sorafenib should be avoided in such a therapeutic setting.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22156795/"}

However, the lower ventricular rates seen after treatment with the calcium antagonists were not associated with improved exercise tolerance, which did not differ significantly between the various treatments. Reduction of the ventricular rate was associated with a small increase in stroke volume but the benefits of this were offset by a rate related reduction in cardiac output. Further reduction of the rapid ventricular rates seen in digitalized patients with AF does not appear to be of benefit in terms of improving either exercise tolerance or cardiac output.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3169046/"}

Oxaliplatin , which is effective for colorectal cancer ( CRC ) in combination with 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) and leucovorin ( LV ) , is widely used for metastatic CRC . With the increasing use of oxaliplatin, however, serious adverse events have been experienced, including hematologic and neurologic toxicities. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether tri-weekly modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) maintenance chemotherapy is associated with a low incidence of severe hematologic and neurologic toxicities in the treatment of patients with metastatic CRC. ### methodology We developed a new treatment regimen with mFOLFOX6 biweekly for 8-10 consecutive cycles (induction phase) followed by a 3-week rest period, after which treatment was resumed with cycles of tri-weekly mFOLFOX6 at standard doses (maintenance phase). Validity and complications were investigated retrospectively. ### results Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in this study. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times were 9.4 months and 23 months, respectively. All patients had peripheral neuropathy during treatment, but grade 3 neurotoxicity was observed in only 2 patients (6.9%). ### conclusions mFOLFOX6 maintenance chemotherapy was associated with a very low incidence of grade 3 hematologic and neurologic toxicities. The toxicities associated with PFS and OS were comparable to those reported in the treatment of patients with metastatic CRC. A tri-weekly mFOLFOX maintenance strategy of alternative treatment with a less-toxic regimen may reduce toxicity and maintain efficacy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22234064/"}

It is impossible to unravel such problems without using a systems approach, i.e. focussing on processes, not just molecular components. This inevitably involves modelling as the interactions require quantitative analysis. Modelling is a tool of analysis aimed at understanding, first, and predicting, eventually.

At all concentration levels there was a statistically significant difference between the treatments, with the highest release of endotoxin per killed bacterium for cefuroxime, lower for tobramycin and the lowest for the combination of the two drugs (P < 0.001). With increasing doses, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the propensity to release endotoxin.

This reduction in endotoxin release was not caused by an unspecific endotoxin binding of tobramycin. ### conclusions Addition of tobramycin reduced the cefuroxime-induced endotoxin release per killed bacterium to a level which was even lower than that of tobramycin alone in spite of an increased killing rate. Increasing concentrations of tobramycin led to reduction in endotoxin release, which may be of benefit when dosing aminoglycosides once daily.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11168076/"}

The protein kinase phosphatase 1 nuclear targeting subunit (PNUTS) has recently been shown to interact with c-Myc protein and suppresses c-Myc protein degradation. Here we screened the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-Approved Oncology Drugs Set V from the National Cancer Institute, and identified tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including ponatinib and lapatinib, as the Approved Oncology Drugs exerting the best synergistic anticancer effects with THZ1 in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells.

In addition, PNUTS knockdown resulted in decreased N-Myc protein but not mRNA expression and decreased MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell proliferation and survival.

Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer have persistent, long-term risk of breast-cancer recurrence and death. Therefore, trials assessing endocrine therapies for this patient population need extended follow-up. We present an update of efficacy outcomes in the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 study at 8\u00b71 years median follow-up. ### methods BIG 1-98 is a randomised, phase 3, double-blind trial of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer that compares 5 years of tamoxifen or letrozole monotherapy, or sequential treatment with 2 years of one of these drugs followed by 3 years of the other. Randomisation was done with permuted blocks, and stratified according to the two-arm or four-arm randomisation option, participating institution, and chemotherapy use. Patients, investigators, data managers, and medical reviewers were masked. The primary efficacy endpoint was disease-free survival (events were invasive breast cancer relapse, second primaries [contralateral breast and non-breast], or death without previous cancer event). Secondary endpoints were overall survival, distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), and breast cancer-free interval (BCFI). The monotherapy comparison included patients randomly assigned to tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years. In 2005 , after a significant disease-free survival benefit was reported for letrozole as compared with tamoxifen , a protocol amendment facilitated the crossover to letrozole of patients who were still receiving tamoxifen alone ; Cox models and Kaplan-Meier estimates with inverse probability of censoring weighting ( IPCW ) are used to account for selective crossover to letrozole of patients ( n=619 ) in the tamoxifen arm . Comparison of sequential treatments to letrozole monotherapy included patients enrolled and randomly assigned to letrozole for 5 years, letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years, or tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years. Treatment has ended for all patients and detailed safety results for adverse events that occurred during the 5 years of treatment have been reported elsewhere. Follow-up is continuing for those enrolled in the four-arm option. BIG 1-98 is registered at clinicaltrials.govNCT00004205. ### findings 8010 patients were included in the trial, with a median follow-up of 8\u00b71 years (range 0-12\u00b74). 2459 were randomly assigned to monotherapy with tamoxifen for 5 years and 2463 to monotherapy with letrozole for 5 years.

At a median follow-up of 8\u00b77 years from randomisation (range 0-12\u00b74), letrozole monotherapy was significantly better than tamoxifen, whether by IPCW or intention-to-treat analysis (IPCW disease-free survival HR 0\u00b782 [95% CI 0\u00b774-0\u00b792], overall survival HR 0\u00b779 [0\u00b769-0\u00b790], DRFI HR 0\u00b779 [0\u00b768-0\u00b792], BCFI HR 0\u00b780 [0\u00b770-0\u00b792]; intention-to-treat disease-free survival HR 0\u00b786 [0\u00b778-0\u00b796], overall survival HR 0\u00b787 [0\u00b777-0\u00b7999], DRFI HR 0\u00b786 [0\u00b774-0\u00b7998], BCFI HR 0\u00b786 [0\u00b776-0\u00b798]). At a median follow-up of 8\u00b70 years from randomisation (range 0-11\u00b72) for the comparison of the sequential groups with letrozole monotherapy, there were no statistically significant differences in any of the four endpoints for either sequence. 8-year intention-to-treat estimates (each with SE \u22641\u00b71%) for letrozole monotherapy, letrozole followed by tamoxifen, and tamoxifen followed by letrozole were 78\u00b76%, 77\u00b78%, 77\u00b73% for disease-free survival; 87\u00b75%, 87\u00b77%, 85\u00b79% for overall survival; 89\u00b79%, 88\u00b77%, 88\u00b71% for DRFI; and 86\u00b71%, 85\u00b73%, 84\u00b73% for BCFI. ### interpretation For postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer, a reduction in breast cancer recurrence and mortality is obtained by letrozole monotherapy when compared with tamoxifen montherapy.

Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an optimal cut-off value of 75% using the maximum of sensitivity and specificity for CEA response to discriminate CEA responders from non-responders. In addition, the time to CEA nadir was calculated. ### results Of 592 patients in the intent-to-treat population, 472 were eligible for analysis of CEA (cetuximab arm: 230 and bevacizumab arm: 242). Maximal relative CEA decrease (%) significantly (P = 0.003) differed between the cetuximab arm (median 83.0%; IQR 40.9%-94.7%) and the bevacizumab arm (median 72.3%; IQR 26.3%-91.0%). In a longitudinal analysis, the CEA decrease occurred faster in the cetuximab arm and was greater than in the bevacizumab arm at all evaluated time points until 56 weeks after treatment start. CEA nadir occurred after 3.3 months (cetuximab arm) and 3.5 months (bevacizumab arm), (P = 0.49). In the cetuximab arm, CEA responders showed a significantly longer progression-free survival [11.8 versus 7.4 months; hazard ratio (HR) 1.53; 95% Cl, 1.15-2.04; P = 0.004] and longer overall survival (36.6 versus 21.3 months; HR 1.73; 95% Cl, 1.24-2.43; P = 0.001) than CEA non-responders. Analysis of extended RAS wild-type patients revealed similar results. ### conclusion In the FIRE-3 trial, CEA decrease was significantly faster and greater in the cetuximab arm than in the bevacizumab arm and correlated with the prolonged survival observed in patients receiving FOLFIRI plus cetuximab. ### Clinical Trials Number NCT00433927 (ClinicalTrials.gov); AIO KRK0306 FIRE-3.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27234640/"}

Combination adjuvant chemotherapy is superior to S-1 monotherapy. Adjuvant radiation therapy after D2 gastrectomy for node-positive gastric cancer does not improve survival. Preoperative chemotherapy with FLOT ( 5-FU , leucovorin , oxaliplatin and docetaxel ) without radiation therapy is the standard treatment in the West .

The third-generation aromatase inhibitors ( AIs ) , including anastrozole , exemestane and letrozole , have demonstrated improved efficacy versus tamoxifen for the adjuvant endocrine treatment of postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer . AIs can be used in several adjuvant endocrine settings: as upfront therapy, switch to an AI after 2-3years of tamoxifen or extended therapy following 5years of tamoxifen. In the switch setting, two different types of study designs have been utilized. One is a late randomization design which randomizes patients who are disease-free after 2-3years of tamoxifen to receive an AI versus continuation of tamoxifen. In contrast, an early randomization design randomizes all patients immediately after primary treatment and prior to starting tamoxifen. Efficacy benefits with AIs have been shown in several trials evaluating the late randomization strategy, including the Intergroup exemestane Study, the Italian tamoxifen anastrozole trial and the anastrozole-Nolvadex 95 trial.

A density functional study. To examine how azole inhibitors interact with the heme active site of the cytochrome P450 enzymes, we have performed a series of density functional theory studies on azole binding. These are the first density functional studies on azole interactions with a heme center and give fundamental insight into how azoles inhibit the catalytic function of P450 enzymes. Since azoles come in many varieties, we tested three typical azole motifs representing a broad range of azole and azole-type inhibitors: methylimidazolate, methyltriazolate, and pyridine. These structural motifs represent typical azoles , such as econazole , fluconazole , and metyrapone . The calculations show that azole binding is a stepwise mechanism whereby first the water molecule from the resting state of P450 is released from the sixth binding site of the heme to create a pentacoordinated active site followed by coordination of the azole nitrogen to the heme iron. This process leads to the breaking of a hydrogen bond between the resting state water molecule and the approaching inhibitor molecule. Although, formally, the water molecule is released in the first step of the reaction mechanism and a pentacoordinated heme is created, this does not lead to an observed spin state crossing. Thus, we show that release of a water molecule from the resting state of P450 enzymes to create a pentacoordinated heme will lead to a doublet to quartet spin state crossing at an Fe-OH(2) distance of approximately 3.0 A, while the azole substitution process takes place at shorter distances. Azoles bind heme with significantly stronger binding energies than a water molecule, so that these inhibitors block the catalytic cycle of the enzyme and prevent oxygen binding and the catalysis of substrate oxidation. Perturbations within the active site (e.g., a polarized environment) have little effect on the relative energies of azole binding. Studies with an extra hydrogen-bonded ethanol molecule in the model, mimicking the active site of the CYP121 P450, show that the resting state and azole binding structures are close in energy, which may lead to chemical equilibrium between the two structures, as indeed observed with recent protein structural studies that have demonstrated two distinct azole binding mechanisms to P450 heme.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18563875/"}

In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) including atezolizumab, durvalumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab have reported their efficacy and safety profile in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). However, given the diverse efficacy and inconsistent safety among the ICIs, with the absence of head-to-head researches designed to evaluate the efficacy among them, it might bring with confusion on selection in clinical practice. ### objectives The present systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed to conduct indirect comparisons on efficacy and safety profile among ICIs , including atezolizumab , durvalumab , pembrolizumab , and nivolumab as first-line treatment in patients with ES-SCLC . ### design Several databases were retrieved with established criteria until June 20, 2020, with the main MeSH Terms and their similarities. Hazard ratios of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), odds ratios (ORs) of disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs) were compared indirectly with network meta-analysis. ### Data Sources Medline, Cochrane library, and Embase. ### Eligibility Criteria Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical studies, which reported PFS, OS, and AEs. ### Data Extraction And Synthesis Clinical characteristics were extracted by the 2 authors independently. Comparisons of HRs were calculated for PFS and OS by random effect model. ORR, DCR, and AEs were presented with ORs. Based on surface under the cumulative ranking curve, and forest plots, efficacy and safety of the treatments were ranked, with predicted histogram described. ### results In total, there were 4 studies including 1547 patients who met the eligibility criteria and enrolled. For indirect comparisons, no significant difference on PFS was observed between atezolizumab and durvalumab (HR 0.96, 95% CI, 0.72-1.29), or between atezolizumab and pembrolizumab (HR 1.05, 95% CI, 0.78-1.43), or between atezolizumab and nivolumab (HR 1.18, 95% CI, 0.79-1.79), or between durvalumab and pembrolizumab (HR 1.10, 95% CI, 0.84-1.43). or between durvalumab and nivolumab (HR 1.23, 95% CI, 0.83-1.82), or between pembrolizumab and nivolumab (HR 1.12, 95% CI, 0.76-1.66), nor significant difference on OS observed between atezolizumab and durvalumab (HR 0.93, 95% CI, 0.67-1.30), or between atezolizumab and pembrolizumab (HR 0.88, 95% CI, 0.62-1.24), or between atezolizumab and nivolumab (HR 1.04, 95% CI, 0.66-1.66), or between durvalumab and pembrolizumab (HR 0.94, 95% CI, 0.70-1.25), or between durvalumab and nivolumab (HR 1.12, 95% CI, 0.73-1.71), or between pembrolizumab and nivolumab (HR 1.19, 95% CI, 0.77-1.84).

At the last dose level of curcumin, three dose-limiting toxicities were observed and two out of three patients at this dose level refused to continue treatment, leading us to define the maximal tolerated dose of curcumin at 8,000 mg/d. Eight patients out of 14 had measurable lesions according to RECIST criteria, with five PR and three SD. Some improvements as biological and clinical responses were observed in most patients. ### Patients And Methods Patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer were eligible. docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)) was administered as a 1 h i.v. infusion every 3 w on d 1 for six cycles. curcumin was orally given from 500 mg/d for seven consecutive d by cycle (from d-4 to d+2) and escalated until a dose-limiting toxicity should occur.

However, the molecular mechanisms which mediate this redistribution of lymphocytes from lymphocyte reservoirs into the circulation remain unknown. We hypothesized that this form of lymphocytosis was in part due to shedding of cell adhesion molecules from the cell surface and a subsequent detachment of lymphocytes adhering to the vascular endothelium in lymphocyte reservoirs. In this study, healthy human volunteers (n = 12) were exercised on a treadmill until exhaustion. The circulating levels of the soluble cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and E-Selectin were determined by ELISA. The subjects were then randomly assigned to treatment with either propranolol or metoprolol and repeated the exercise protocol after 1 week of treatment . Prior to drug treatment, soluble ICAM-1 levels rose from 258 +/- 19 to 321 +/- 28 ng/ml following exercise and returned to approximate baseline levels of 263 +/- 22 ng/ml after 1 h of rest. This highly significant effect of exercise on circulating ICAM-1 levels (p < .005) was mitigated after treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonists.

Selective inhibitors of 11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type I may be of therapeutical interest for two reasons: i) 9alpha-Fluorinated 11-dehydrosteroids like 11-dehydro-dexamethasone (DH-D) are rapidly activated by human kidney 11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type II (11beta-HSD-II) to dexamethasone (D). If the same reaction by hepatic 11beta-HSD-I could be selectively inhibited, DH-D could be used for selective renal immunosuppressive therapy. ii) Reduction of cortisone to cortisol in the liver may increase insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and inhibition of the enzyme may lead to a decrease in gluconeogenesis. Therefore, we characterized the metabolism of DH-D by human hepatic 11beta-HSD-I and tried to find a selective inhibitor of this isoenzyme. ### methods For kinetic analysis of 11beta-HSD-I, we used microsomes prepared from unaffected parts of liver segments, resected because of hepatocarcinoma or metastatic disease. For inhibition experiments, we also tested 11beta-HSD-II activity with human kidney cortex microsomes. The inhibitory potency of several compounds was evaluated for oxidation and reduction in concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-5)mol/l. ### results Whereas D was not oxidized by human liver microsomes at all, cortisol was oxidized to cortisone with a maximum velocity (V(max)) of 95pmol/mg per min. The reduction of DH-D to D (V(max)=742pmol/mg per min, Michaelis--Menten constant (K(m))=1.6 micromol/l) was faster than that of cortisone to cortisol (V(max)=187pmol/mg per min). All reactions tested in liver microsomes showed the characteristics of 11beta-HSD-I: K(m) values in the micromolar range, preferred cosubstrate NADP(H), no product inhibition. Of the substances tested for inhibition of 11beta-HSD-I and -II , chenodeoxycholic acid was the only one that selectively inhibited 11beta-HSD-I ( IC(50 ) for reduction : 2.8x10(-6)mol/l , IC(50 ) for oxidation : 4.4x10(-6)mol/l ) , whereas ketoconazole preferentially inhibited oxidation and reduction reactions catalyzed by 11beta-HSD-II . metyrapone, which is reduced to metyrapol by hepatic 11beta-HSD-I, inhibited steroid reductase activity of 11beta-HSD-I and -II and oxidative activity of 11beta-HSD-II. These findings can be explained by substrate competition for reductase reactions and by product inhibition of the oxidation, which is a well-known characteristic of 11beta-HSD-II. ### conclusions Our in vitro results may offer a new concept for renal glucocorticoid targeting. Oral administration of small amounts of DH-D (low substrate affinity for 11beta-HSD-I) in combination with chenodeoxycholic acid (selective inhibition of 11beta-HSD-I) may prevent hepatic first pass reduction of DH-D, thus allowing selective activation of DH-D to D by the high affinity 11beta-HSD-II in the kidney. Moreover, selective inhibitors of the hepatic 11beta-HSD-I, like chenodeoxycholic acid, may become useful in the therapy of patients with hepatic insulin resistance including diabetes mellitus type II, because cortisol enhances gluconeogenesis.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10664531/"}

However, our understanding of the therapeutic effects of this hormone is still marginal and there is little information concerning its combination with other antitumor agents to achieve additional potential benefits. All-trans retinoic acids or somatostatin have been used in combination with melatonin in several pre-clinical and clinical trials, but they have never been combined altogether as an anti-breast cancer treatment. In the present study, we investigated whether the association of melatonin, all-trans retinoic acid and somatostatin leads to an enhanced anticancer activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In such conditions, MCF-7 cells were investigated for cell growth/viability and proliferation, as well as for the expression of cyclin A, and components of the Notch and EGFR pathways, by Western blotting and confocal immunofluorescence. Electrophysiological, morphological, and biochemical analysis were also performed to reveal signs of cell damage and death. We found that melatonin in combination with all-trans retinoic acid and somatostatin potentiated the effects of melatonin alone on MCF-7 cell viability and growth inhibition ; this phenomenon was associated with altered conductance through Ca\u00b2\u207a and voltage-activated K\u207a ( BK ) channels , and with substantial impairments of Notch-1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated signaling . The combined treatment also caused a marked reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ATP production as well as induction of necrotic cell death.

Using a phosphorylation antibody microarray, we revealed that PI3K/AKT pathway contained the most phosphorylated proteins/hits, while apoptosis pathway that may be regulated by PKC displayed the greatest fold enrichment in the resistant cells. The PI3K/AKT inhibitor IPI-145 failed to reverse the resistance. In contrast, the pan-PKC inhibitor midostaurin exhibited potent antitumor activity in both original and resistant cells, alone or in combination with rituximab. Notably, midostaurin promoted apoptosis by reducing the phosphorylation of PKC and consequently of downstream Bad, Bcl-2 and NF-\u03baB.

Mutations in the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase gene (KIT), which result in constitutive activation of the protein (KIT), are causally related to the development of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). imatinib, a targeted anticancer drug, exerts a therapeutic effect against GISTs by repressing the kinase activity of KIT. Long-term administration of this drug, however, causes the emergence of imatinib-resistant GISTs. We performed quantitative phosphoproteome analysis using a cell-based GIST model system comprising an imatinib-sensitive GIST cell line (GIST882), GIST882 under treatment with imatinib (GIST882-IM), and secondary imatinib-resistant GIST882 (GIST882-R). Phosphorylated peptides were purified from each cell line using titania-based affinity chromatography or anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation, and then subjected to LC-MS/MS based quantitative phosphoproteome analysis. Using this method we identified augmentation of the kinase activities of multiple elements of the signal transduction pathway, especially KIT and EGFR. Although, these elements were up-regulated in GIST882-R, no additionally mutated KIT mRNA was found in secondary imatinib-resistant GIST cells.

The goal of the study was to investigate the mechanism of acquired resistance in GISTs against imatinib, a molecularly targeted drug that inhibits kinase activity of the KIT protein and that has been approved for the treatment of GISTs. In imatinib-resistant GIST cells, we observed elevated expression of KIT and restoration of its kinase activity, as well as activation of multiple proliferative signaling pathways. Our results indicate that the effects of even so-called 'molecularly targeted' drugs, are broad rather than convergent, and that the mechanisms of action of such drugs during continuous administration are extremely complex.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25554490/"}

The history of anti-obesity drug development is far from glorious, with transient magic bullets and only a handful of agents currently licensed for clinical use. In view of recent progress in our understanding of the multiplicity of signalling pathways involved in appetite regulation, and the resultant deluge of reports on the anorectic efficacy of novel therapies, it seems timely to stress the need to differentiate treatments that suppress intake by primary means from those that only indirectly achieve this endpoint. The current article reviews the conceptual history of the behavioural satiety sequence (BSS), also known as the behavioural sequence of satiety, post-ingestive satiety, and the postprandial satiety sequence. Early research confirmed that natural satiation, produced by a caloric load on the gut, is associated with a predictable transition from feeding through grooming to resting. Although many less naturalistic manipulations are also capable of reducing food intake, very few do so without disrupting the normal structure of this feeding cycle. Thus, while CCK and d-fenfluramine reduce intake by accelerating but otherwise maintaining the integrity of the BSS, other anorectic interventions disrupt the BSS through response competition (e.g. d-amphetamine), nausea/discomfort (e.g. lithium chloride) and/or interference with taste-mediated positive feedback (e.g. quinine adulteration of the diet). A substantial literature now strongly supports the specific involvement of serotonin 5-HT(1B ) and 5-HT(2C ) receptor subtypes in satiety and in the anorectic effect of agents such as fenfluramine and fluoxetine . Recent BSS analyses have also identified rather selective anorectic profiles for the dual noradrenaline and 5-HT reuptake inhibitor sibutramine, the orexin-1 receptor antagonist SB-334867, and the broad spectrum opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. However, similar analyses have offered little/no support for the anorectic potential of the gut peptide PYY(3-36) while the acute anorectic efficacy of cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonists appears largely to be secondary to response competition. In contrast, studies with low-dose combinations of naloxone and CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonists have very recently confirmed the potential of drug polytherapies not only in appetite suppression but also in attenuating/eliminating unwanted side-effects. In sum, as BSS analysis offers a reliable means of differentiating the wheat (primary anorectics) from the chaff (secondary anorectics), it should form an integral part of early phase testing in any anti-obesity drug screening programme.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20214921/"}

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is characterized by excellent response to treatment, if diagnosed correctly. Lifestyle advice is an integral part of the treatment of JME; it should include recommendations on avoidance of common triggers such as sleep deprivation and alcohol excess and emphasis on the importance of compliance with medication. The drug of first choice in the treatment of JME is sodium valproate, which has a response rate of up to 80%. Valproate should be avoided in women of childbearing age because of significantly increased risks of fetal malformations and neurodevelopmental delay. levetiracetam or lamotrigine are alternative first-line options if valproate is contraindicated. With limited data from trials to support either of these drugs, the choice should take into account comorbidity factors and patient priorities. Because of its low side effect profile, excellent tolerability, and lack of interactions with other drugs, levetiracetam is our preferred alternative first-line agent. lamotrigine is another first-line option but may exacerbate myoclonus. The failure of valproate or failure of two first-line antiepileptic drugs suggests that combination therapy is indicated. Drug interactions and the patient's gender, age, and comorbidities need to be considered. levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and valproate are suitable adjuncts, with a synergistic effect reported from the combination of valproate and lamotrigine. clonazepam is a useful adjunct for myoclonus and can be used in combination with lamotrigine to avoid lamotrigine's myoclonic effects. In women of childbearing potential , valproate should be considered if levetiracetam and lamotrigine have failed to control seizures at this stage . topiramate is a cost-effective alternative monotherapy, but because of its poor tolerability, we recommend it as add-on treatment only. zonisamide should remain a second-line adjunct in the treatment of JME, owing to the lack of supportive data. Phenobarbital is the most cost-effective drug and can be used to control the seizures of JME when antiepileptic drugs are limited or too costly. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin can exacerbate absences and myoclonus and are therefore contraindicated, although they can improve control of tonic-clonic seizures when these are refractory to other medication. gabapentin, pregabalin, tiagabine, and vigabatrin are contraindicated and can worsen seizures.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) of multi-factorial etiopathogenesis is rising worldwide. Treatment-associated toxicity problems and treatment failure in advanced disease stages with conventional therapies have necessitated a focus on alternative strategies. Molecular targeted therapy, with the potential for increased selectivity and fewer adverse effects, hold promise in the treatment of HNSCC. In an attempt to improve outcomes in HNSCC, targeted therapeutic strategies have been developed. These strategies are focusing on the molecular biology of HNSCC in an attempt to target selected pathways involved in carcinogenesis. Inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis by focusing on specific protein or signal transduction pathways or by targeting the tumor microenvironment or vasculature are some of the new approaches. Targeted agents for HNSCC expected to improve the effectiveness of current therapy include EGFR inhibitors ( Cetuximab , Panitumumab , Zalutumumab ) , EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( Gefitinib , Erloitinib ) , VEGFR inhibitors ( Bevacizumab , Vandetanib ) , and various inhibitors of , e.g. , Src-family kinase , PARP , proteasome , mTOR , COX , and heat shock protein .

CAH is an uncommon disorder that results from a defect in steroid hormones biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex. The clinical presentation depends on the site of enzymatic mutations and the types of accumulated steroid precursors. A 22-year-old woman who was diagnosed to have hypertension since the age of 10 years who was treated with anti-hypertensive therapy was referred to the National Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, Royal Hospital, Oman. The patient also had primary amenorrhea and features of sexual infantilism. Full laboratory and radio-imaging investigations were done. Adrenal steroids, pituitary function and karyotyping study were performed and the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular mutation study. Laboratory investigations revealed adrenal steroids and pituitary hormones profile in addition to 46XY karyotype that are consistent with the diagnosis of CAH due to 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency. Extensive laboratory workup revealed low levels of serum cortisol (and its precursors 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-deoxycortisol), adrenal androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstenedione), and estrogen (estradiol); and high levels of mineralocorticoids precursors (11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone) with high levels of ACTH, FSH and LH.

Although there are now a number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) available, approximately one-third of epilepsy patients respond poorly to drug intervention. The reasons for this are complex, but are probably reflective of the increasing number of identified mutations that predispose individuals to this disease. Thus, there is a clear requirement for the development of novel treatments to address this unmet clinical need. The existence of gene mutations that mimic a seizure-like behaviour in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, offers the possibility to exploit the powerful genetics of this insect to identify novel cellular targets to facilitate design of more effective AEDs. In this study we use neuronal expression of GCaMP, a potent calcium reporter, to image neuronal activity using a non-invasive and rapid method. Expression in motoneurons in the isolated CNS of third instar larvae shows waves of calcium-activity that pass between segments of the ventral nerve cord. Time between calcium peaks, in the same neurons, between adjacent segments usually show a temporal separation of greater than 200 ms. Exposure to proconvulsants (picrotoxin or 4-aminopyridine) reduces separation to below 200 ms showing increased synchrony of activity across adjacent segments. Increased synchrony, characteristic of epilepsy, is similarly observed in genetic seizure mutants: bangsenseless1 (bss1) and paralyticK1270T (paraK1270T). Exposure of bss1 to clinically-used antiepileptic drugs ( phenytoin or gabapentin ) significantly reduces synchrony . In this study we use the measure of synchronicity to evaluate the effectiveness of known and novel anticonvulsive compounds (antipain, isethionate, etopiside rapamycin and dipyramidole) to reduce seizure-like CNS activity.

These patients had been identified in previous studies to be a group with a relatively poor prognosis. One-third of the patients had an antecedent hematologic disorder prior to treatment. Forty patients (48%) obtained a complete hematologic and clinical remission. A history of an antecedent hematologic disorder, male sex, and absence of Auer rods were adverse factors for achieving remission in this older population. More than half of the patients achieved remission in one course. The major cause of failure to obtain a remission was death due to infection, 40% of which were caused by fungi.

The promising clinical activity of paclitaxel has also promoted considerable interest in combining this drug with other anti-tumor agents. In this study, we assessed the cytotoxic interaction between paclitaxel and gemcitabine administered at various schedules to human breast and ovarian cancer cells. Through a series of in vitro assays including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, DNA fragmentation, and flow cytometric analyses, we found that gemcitabine could significantly antagonize the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel when tumor cells were exposed to the two drugs simultaneously or exposed to gemcitabine before paclitaxel. However, there was little antagonistic interaction observed when paclitaxel was administered before gemcitabine. Further analyses demonstrated that gemcitabine could significantly interfere with the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel on both mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death unless paclitaxel is administered before gemcitabine . In addition, biochemical examinations revealed that pretreatment or cotreatment of gemcitabine inhibited paclitaxel-induced IkappaBalpha degradation and bcl-2 phosphorylation that are believed to play critical roles in the signal pathways leading to apoptotic cell death.

Emphasis was placed on original studies published since 1975. ### Data Extraction Data from published research were extracted and evaluated according to study design, sample size, dosing regimen, outcome measures, and treatment efficacy and safety. ### Data Synthesis Infantile spasms constitute a rare epileptic syndrome with a poor long-term prognosis for normal intellectual development. The spasms are characterized by a brief symmetric contraction of the muscles of the neck, trunk, and/or extremities, often occurring in a series of 2 to more than 100 spasms during a single episode. The disorder is age-specific, with the peak onset of symptoms occurring between 2 and 8 months of age. Spasms of no identifiable cause in infants with normal development prior to the onset of infantile spasms are classified as cryptogenic or idiopathic, whereas those with an identifiable cause are classified as symptomatic. Long-term prognosis is best in cryptogenic cases, with 30-70 percent attaining normal intellect compared with 5-19 percent in symptomatic cases. The etiology and pathophysiology are not well understood. Recent theory postulates that infantile spasms may be caused by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone activity during infancy. The suspected association between the whole-cell pertussis vaccine and infantile spasms is coincidental. Few well-designed, prospective, controlled clinical trials for the treatment of infantile spasms have been conducted. ### conclusions Standard anticonvulsants such as phenytoin , the barbiturates , carbamazepine , and the succinimides have been ineffective . Of the anticonvulsants, only the benzodiazepines, valproic acid, and vigabatrin have shown efficacy in reducing spasm frequency and severity. Hormonal therapy with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and/or prednisone has been the most frequently studied treatment modality and appears to be the most effective. Hormonal therapy achieves complete spasm control in 50-75 percent of infants within four weeks of initiation. Opinions differ regarding the relative efficacy between ACTH and prednisone, the need for early initiation of hormonal treatment, and the benefits of high dosages of ACTH (> 40 units/d). No treatment has been shown conclusively to improve the long-term intellectual development of these infants. Neurosurgery may be the treatment of choice in select cases when a localized central nervous system abnormality can be demonstrated. Well-designed, blind, prospective clinical trials are needed to answer definitively many lingering questions regarding the treatment of infantile spasms.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7919570/"}

Insensitivity towards anthracycline drugs like doxorubicin poses a significant challenge in the treatment of breast cancer. Among several factors, Aurora A (a mitotic serine threonine kinase) plays crucial roles in acquiring non-responsiveness towards doxorubicin. However, the mechanisms underlying need to be elucidated. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of Aurora A mediated doxorubicin insensitivity in MCF-7Dox/R, an isolated resistant-subline of MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma cell line). Effect of curcumin, a natural phytochemical in restoring doxorubicin sensitivity by targeting Aurora A was assessed furthermore. ### methods A doxorubicin resistant subline (MCF-7Dox/R) was isolated from the parental MCF-7 cells by treating the cell with gradual step-wise increasing concentration of the drug. Expressions of Aurora A and its target proteins (Akt, I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF\u03baB) were assessed in both parental and MCF-7Dox/R cells. Both the cell lines were pretreated with curcumin prior to doxorubicin treatment. Cellular proliferation rate was measured using BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) assay kit. Intracellular doxorubicin accumulation was estimated spectrofluorimetrically. Cellular uptake of curcumin (spectrophotometric and spectrofluorimetric method) and its nuclear localization was confirmed by confocal microscopic study. Protein expressions were determined by western blot analysis. Localization of Aurora A was ascertained by immunofluorescence assay. To explore the possible outcome of impact of curcumin on Aurora A, cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis were performed subsequently. ### results Higher expressions of Aurora A in MCF-7Dox/R cells led to phosphorylation of Akt as well as I\u03baB\u03b1. Phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 preceded release of NF\u03baB.

Grade 3 and 4 non-hematological toxicity, occurred significantly more often with LTC (23% versus 4%, p=0.005) and was associated with a higher dropout rate. PFS and OS were not significantly different among both arms. The LTC arm showed inferiority in the stratum with residual tumor of more than 1cm: median PFS was 11.5 months (95% CI: 7.4-14.2) compared with 16.4 (95% CI: 10.3-40.4) for TC (p=0.0141; HR=0.36 (95% CI: 0.15-0.84)) with median OS 20.6 months (95% CI: 13.1-31.0) and 43.4 months (95% CI: 15.7-) for the TC arm (p=0.012; HR=0.32 (95% CI: 0.13-0.8)). ### conclusion The addition of lonafarnib did not improve PFS or OS. Patients with a residual tumor of more than 1cm had significantly shorter PFS and OS. Incorporation of lonafarnib into future studies for primary therapy of OC is not recommended.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22564713/"}

This study's objective was to determine the prevalence of body shape changes and metabolic abnormalities in an ambulant population with HIV infection. Three different definitions of lipodystrophy were used to assess these changes. Patients' anthropometric measures and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were compared in order to estimate fat distribution in this population. We sought to evaluate potential predictors for lipodystrophy according to each of the three definitions. ### methods We performed a cross-sectional study in the outpatient clinic of a tertiary referral hospital in Melbourne, Australia. We enrolled a total of 167 HIV-infected ambulatory patients over 3 months in mid-1998. Data on 159 males, 149 of whom were receiving triple combination antiretroviral therapy, were evaluated. Anthropometric measures, clinical examination, self-report of body shape changes, biochemical measures and DEXA scan were used to assess lipodystrophy and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Patients described body shape changes in the face, trunk, arms and legs. Laboratory parameters measured included fasting triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), glucose, insulin, CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA. Current and past antiretroviral therapies were ascertained. ### results According to one proposed Australian national definition of lipodystrophy (LDNC), the prevalence of lipodystrophy in this population was 65%. This definition included an objective assessment with major and minor criteria. Patient-defined lipodystrophy (LDP), which involved a subjective assessment of thinning arms and legs and central adiposity, occurred in 19%. Patient-defined lipoatrophy (LAP), which involved a subjective assessment of thinning arms and legs without central adiposity, occurred in 21.3%. No change in body habitus was noted by 37% of the cohort. Hypercholesterolaemia was recorded in 44%, hypertriglyceridaemia in 52% and elevated insulin levels in 23%. Anthropometry was predictive of the per cent total body fat recorded by DEXA scan, but produced consistently lower values. In multivariate analysis , LDP and LAP were significantly associated with stavudine ( d4 T ) use , while LAP was also associated with zidovudine ( ZDV ) treatment . There were no treatment associations with LDNC. Protease inhibitor (PI) exposure was associated with metabolic changes but not patient perceived body shape changes, while d4T and ZDV exposure was associated with increased triglycerides and reduced peripheral fat stores. ### conclusions The prevalence of body shape changes in a single population varied depending on the definition applied. The LDNC definition overestimated body shape abnormalities in comparison with patient perception. LAP was associated with significantly lower fat stores measured by anthropometry and DEXA scan than those identified under the LDNC definition. In contrast to LDNC, LAP was associated with d4T exposure, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and ZDV duration of use, but not PI use. Until a consensus definition for lipodystrophy is developed, including agreement on objective measurement and thresholds for abnormality, careful description of the individual components of the syndrome is required to enable cohort comparisons so that predictors of the syndrome can be assessed more accurately and outcome studies made feasible.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11737398/"}

Identification of CYP3A4 as the major isoform responsible for colchicine demethylation. colchicine disposition involves both active biliary and renal excretion of parent drug, and at least in mammals a substantial fraction undergoes hepatic demethylation prior to excretion. We investigated the biotransformation of [3H]colchicine in a panel of microsomal preparations obtained from sixteen human liver samples. The production rate of the main metabolites of colchicine's 3-demethylcolchicine (3DMC) and 2-demethylcolchicine (2DMC), was linear in relation to incubation time, cytochrome (P450) content, and substrate concentration. Following the incubation of colchicine (5 nM) with microsomes in the presence of an NADPH-generating system for 60 min, 9.8% and 5.5% of the substrate were metabolized to 3DMC and 2DMC, respectively. The formation rate of colchicine metabolites exhibited a marked variation between the different microsomal preparations. The formation rates of both colchicine metabolites were correlated significantly with nifedipine oxidase activity, a marker of CYP3A4 activity (r = 0.96, P < 0.001), but not with the metabolic markers of CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 activities.

The coadministration of colchicine with known inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 may inhibit colchicine metabolism, resulting in concentration-related toxicity.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8960070/"}

Furthermore , our group has shown that the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin is effective in anthracycline-resistant ABC . ### Patients And Methods From January 1996 until March 1997, 66 women with ABC were treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) by three-hour infusion followed by carboplatin at an AUC of 6 mg x min/ml every three weeks. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range 28-75). A total of 39 patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy and 22 of them were treated with an anthracycline or mitoxantrone-containing regimen. ### results A total of 324 cycles (median: six) were administered, 273 (85%) of them at full dose. The median number of delivered cycles was six. The median delivered dose intensity (DI) of paclitaxel was 55.1 mg/m2/week (range 30.5-69.3) and the relative DI was 0.95 (range 0.5-1.2). Eight patients (12%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5%-22%) achieved complete and 28 (42%, 95% CI: 30%-55%) partial responses. Grade 3-4 toxicities included anemia (5%), granulocytopenia (24%), thrombocytopenia, nausea/vomiting and allergic reaction (3% each), myalgias/arthralgias and neurotoxicity (1.5% each). Febrile neutropenia occurred in eight (12%) patients. Alopecia was universal. After a median follow-up of 17.3 (range 0.07-24.5) months, 48 (72%) patients have demonstrated tumor progression and 24 (36%) have died. Median time to progression was 8.6 (range 0.07-23+) months and median survival 20.4 (range 0.07-24.5+) months. ### conclusions The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin has moderate activity in ABC and can be easily delivered on an outpatient basis with manageable toxicity. This regimen may be useful especially in patients to whom anthracyclines or cisplatin administration is precluded because of other concomitant diseases.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9818080/"}

Cyclosporine ( 25 mg/kg per day , s.c . ) was given for 7 days to rats either alone or in combination with resveratrol ( 10 mg/kg per day , i.p . ) . Relaxation and contraction responses of aorta were examined. Serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, angiotensin II, and angiotensin 1-7 were measured. Histopathological examinations as well as immunostaining for 4-hydroxynonenal and nitrotyrosine were performed in the kidney. RNA expressions of renin-angiotensin system components were also measured in renal and aortic tissues. cyclosporine decreased the endothelium-dependent relaxation and increased vascular contraction in the aorta. It caused renal tubular degeneration and increased immunostaining for 4-hydroxynonenal, an oxidative stress marker. cyclosporine also caused upregulations of the vasoconstrictive renin-angiotensin system components in renal (angiotensin-converting enzyme) and aortic (angiotensin II type 1 receptor) tissues. resveratrol co-treatment prevented the cyclosporine-related deteriorations. Moreover, it induced the expressions of vasodilatory effective angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin II type 2 receptor in aorta and kidney, respectively.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of further bevacizumab therapy in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer whose disease had progressed after treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. ### methods In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients who had HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after receiving 12 weeks or more of first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy from 118 centres in 12 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a central interactive voice response system using a block randomisation schedule (block size four) stratified by hormone receptor status, first-line progression-free survival, selected chemotherapy, and lactate dehydrogenase concentration, to receive second-line single-agent chemotherapy either alone or with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Second-line therapy was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. At progression, patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone received third-line chemotherapy without bevacizumab; those randomly assigned to bevacizumab continued bevacizumab with third-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival from randomisation to second-line progression or death in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is ongoing, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01250379. ### findings Between Feb 17, 2011, and April 3, 2013, 494 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (247 in each group). The median duration of follow-up at the time of this prespecified primary progression-free survival analysis was 15\u00b79 months (IQR 9\u00b71-21\u00b77) in the chemotherapy-alone group and 16\u00b71 months (10\u00b76-22\u00b77) in the combination group. Progression-free survival was significantly longer for those patients treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy than for those with chemotherapy alone (median: 6\u00b73 months [95% CI 5\u00b74-7\u00b72] vs 4\u00b72 months [3\u00b79-4\u00b77], respectively, stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b775 [95% CI 0\u00b761-0\u00b793], two-sided stratified log-rank p=0\u00b70068). The most common grade 3 or more adverse events were hypertension (33 [13%] of 245 patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy vs 17 [7%] of 238 patients receiving chemotherapy alone), neutropenia (29 [12%] vs 20 [8%]), and hand-foot syndrome (27 [11%] vs 25 [11%]). Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 17 (7%) of 245 patients receiving combination therapy and one (<1%) of 238 patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Serious adverse events were reported in 61 (25%) of 245 patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus 44 (18%) of 238 patients receiving chemotherapy alone. ### interpretation These results suggest that continued VEGF inhibition with further bevacizumab is a valid treatment option for patients with locally recurrent or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer whose disease was stabilised or responded to first-line bevacizumab with chemotherapy. ### funding F Hoffmann-La Roche.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25273342/"}

The combination of paclitaxel and doxorubicin yielded response rates between 63% and 93% in phase I/II studies. In these studies, however, the investigators reported severe cardiac toxic events. The rationale for the current study was therefore to evaluate the combination of paclitaxel/epirubicin, focusing mainly on cardiac toxicity. In two groups, 85 patients with metastatic breast cancer entered the study. Approximately 20% of the patients had primary metastatic breast cancer with large tumors at the primary site. Half of the patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy. Study medication in group A consisted of epirubicin 60 mg/m2 given intravenously over 1 hour, followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion after premedication with steroids, antihistamines, and H2-blockers. In group B , epirubicin 90 mg/m2 was combined with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 , given in the same manner as in group A. Dose escalation to 225 mg/m2 paclitaxel was planned in both groups. The main toxicity in both groups was neutropenia (73% World Health Organization grade 3/4 in group A and 93% in group B). Other hematologic side effects were rare. No febrile neutropenia was reported in group A, but two episodes occurred in group B. Peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia, and myalgia were mild (only World Health Organization grades 1 and 2). Alopecia was universal. In group A, the paclitaxel dose could be escalated to 200 mg/m2 in 15 patients and to 225 mg/m2 in seven patients. Dose reduction due to severe neutropenia was necessary in 11 patients. No cardiac events were reported in group A. In group B, the paclitaxel dose could be escalated to 200 mg/m2 in only one patient, and no patient reached 225 mg/m2. Three patients needed a dose reduction. In this group, one patient had a greater than 10% decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction with no clinical signs. In group A, 43 patients were evaluable for response; in group B, 25 patients were evaluable. Thirteen patients were out of protocol with only bone metastasis, and two patients had more than one prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The response rate was identical in both groups, with five complete remissions and 24 partial remissions in group A and three complete responses and 14 partial remissions in group B. The duration of response was 8.2 months in both groups. The median cumulative epirubicin dose was 420 mg/m2 in group A and 630 mg/m2 in group B. The combination of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and epirubicin 60 or 90 mg/m2 can be administered safely to patients with metastatic breast cancer. Although response was not the primary end point of this trial, the response data are nonetheless encouraging and suggest that further evaluation of this combination-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer is warranted.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9374090/"}

In the 450-mg cohort, four patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. In the 300-mg cohort, two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. Among ALKI-naive patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 35.9-99.6) in the 450-mg cohort and 60% (95% CI: 26.2-87.8) in the 300-mg cohort.

Several human cancers express SSTRs, including prostate cancer, and therefore SMS is of interest for anti-cancer therapy. DNA methylation and histone modifications are involved in normal cell development, gene imprinting and human carcinogenesis. Reversing DNA methylation is an attractive therapeutic possibility, since epigenetic modifications change gene expression without changing the gene function. DNA methylation inhibitors such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5'-aza, decitabine) have been used to treat several types of haematological malignancies. Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin (TSA), are a new class of 'targeted anti-cancer agents'. TSA and decitabine can induce growth arrest, apoptosis or terminal differentiation in a variety of solid and haematological cancers in advanced disease patients. In the present study, the LNCaP cell line (prostate cancer) was incubated with SMS or Somadex (an SMS polymer conjugate) for three days, 1 nM per day, and the untreated cells were the negative control. For DNA demethylation, cells were grown in the presence of 2.5 microM 5-aza for 120 h, and re-fed with 5-aza-containing fresh medium at day 3. The total incubation time with 5-aza was 120 h. TSA at 1.0 microM was added into the cultured cells for 24 h. The combined treatment of 5-aza and TSA was performed by incubating the cells with 5-aza for 120 h followed by a 24-h exposure to TSA. Using cDNA obtained from these cell lines, the difference in the expression level of SSTR mRNA transcripts before and after 5-aza and TSA treatments was analyzed by RT-PCR. An increased induction of mRNA expression of the five SSTR subtypes was observed in the LNCaP cells when incubated with SMS/Somadex (dose-dependent). The inhibition of DNA methylation and histone acetylation resulted in the up-regulation of SSTR5 mRNA expression. The results demonstrate a positive feedback loop between SMS and its receptors. This regulation pathway may enhance the anti-tumor activity of somatostatin. To benefit from this effect in a clinical setting, the dose, dose frequency and pan affinity of the SMS derivative are important factors. The epigenetic manipulation with DNA methylation or histone deacetylase inhibitors, combined with SMS, may offer a novel alternative for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18575731/"}

The intent of the present study was to determine whether this relationship extends to lymphomas produced from these cell lines in syngeneic mice, after treatment with the same chemotherapy agents. ### methods LY-ar and LY-as tumors were grown in the hind legs of syngeneic mice.

Apoptotic bodies were scored in histological sections of tumors that had been stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tumor growth delay was determined on tumors that were treated when they were 8 mm in diameter. Thereafter, tumor diameter was measured daily with a vernier caliper until they had grown to a maximum of 16 mm in diameter. ### results When transplanted into host animals, tumors derived from these two cell lines and treated in vivo with CP, VP-16, ADR, ara-C, CY, and CAM displayed apoptotic propensities similar to those seen in the same cell lines when treated in vitro. Generally, for all the drugs tested, apoptotic indices in LY-as tumors were significantly higher than in LY-ar tumors.

For some drugs LY-ar tumors were more sensitive than LY-as tumors (CP, Vp-16, ADR, ara-C), yet LY-ar tumors were more resistant to CY. ### conclusions Despite considerable interest in using apoptotic indices as predictors of treatment outcome, the data presented here suggest that these relationships are very complex.

Others were neovascular age related macular degeneration, neovascular glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, myopic choroidal neovascularization and cystoid macular edema. There was an association between age and disease, (p = 0.001). There was an improvement in visual acuity after intervention in cases with retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema, and this was statistically significant. Hypertension was the commonest systemic disorder in this series 81(42.36%) and the supero-temporal quadrant 131(68.95%) was the most preferred position to administer the injection. Floaters was the commonest complication seen. ### conclusion Anti VEGFs have become an invaluable tool in the management of a number of retinal diseases in our center. However, the cost implications are a hindrance to an increased uptake of this form of treatment. Cheaper alternative preparations should be made available to encourage the uptake. Government in developing countries should be encouraged to bear the health burden of the old aged pensioner (OAP).", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29299078/"}

HL-60 cell line, normal myeloid progenitor cluster of differentiation (CD)-34(+) cells, and granulocytes were incubated for 4 or 24 hours at different concentrations of curcumin and/or etoposide. Brown Norway rats with acute myeloid leukemia (BNML) were used to prove the influence of curcumin on etoposide action in vivo.

In contrast, curcumin did not significantly modify etoposide-induced cytotoxicity and H2AX phosphorylation in normal CD34(+) cells and granulocytes. curcumin modified the cytotoxic action of etoposide in HL-60 cells through intensification of free radical production because preincubation with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) significantly reduced the cytotoxic effect of curcumin itself and a combination of two compounds. In contrast, NAC did not decrease the cytotoxic effect of etoposide. Thus, oxidative stress plays a greater role in the cytotoxic effect of curcumin than that of etoposide in HL-60 cells. In vitro results were confirmed in a BNML model. Pretreatment with curcumin enhanced the antileukemic activity of etoposide in BNML rats (1.57-fold tumor reduction versus etoposide alone; P<0.05) and induced apoptosis of BNML cells more efficiently than etoposide alone (1.54-fold change versus etoposide alone; P<0.05), but this treatment protected nonleukemic B-cells from apoptosis.

Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and favipiravir, which were highly distributed to the lung, were reported to reduce viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, drugs with poor lung distributions, including lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir and remdesivir, were insufficient to inhibit viral replication. lopinavir/ritonavir might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract according to their distribution profiles.

Prostatic cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in males. Treatment by radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy is useful in the early stages of the disease. Whenever metastases occur, patients are usually treated by surgical (orchidectomy) or medical [gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue] castration. This form of treatment is, however, associated with unwanted adverse effects, such as flushing, loss of libido and potency and all patients ultimately escape therapy after a delay of 1 to 2 years. For this reason antiandrogens have been developed as another means of endocrine ablation therapy. Antiandrogens fall in 2 groups of which the first group, the steroidal antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate (CPA), have a direct blocking effect at the cellular level but also inhibit testosterone production by their additional gestagenic properties blocking gonadotropin secretion. Except in preventing the flare-up associated with the start of GnRH analogue therapy and in reducing flushing, no evidence exist of any superiority for CPA over classical therapy in terms of adverse effects and survival. The second group, the nonsteroidal or 'pure' antiandrogens, only block androgens at the cellular level without any central effects. In contrast with other forms of castration, patients on pure antiandrogens as monotherapy preserve their sexual function and potency, at the expense of a slightly inferior androgen blockade and gynecomastia. These latter effects are explained by a compensatory rise in androgens as a result of the blockade at the central level, which weakens the androgen blockade, and by peripheral aromatisation of the increased androgens to oestrogens. In addition, some evidence exist that pure antiandrogens improve survival if combined with other forms of castration as they also inhibit the adrenal androgens, the so-called maximal androgen blockade (MAB). If patients escape control under MAB, a trial of stopping the antiandrogen must always be considered, as some tumours have 'learned' to be activated by these drugs. At the moment it is not yet clear if antiandrogens are of any benefit in downstaging the extent of disease before prostatectomy and/or radiotherapy. Of the currently known pure antiandrogens , bicalutamide offers some advantages over flutamide as it possesses a much longer half-life , allowing a once daily regimen , and has advantages over nilutamide in terms of fewer adverse effects .", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9592622/"}

The protective effects of lutein (100 microM), zeaxanthin (100 microM), meclofenamic acid (30 microM), and resveratrol (10 microM) were investigated by pretreatment with the above agents before toxicant exposure in acute toxicity models and cotreatment with the toxicant in chronic toxicity models. The synergistic effects of acrolein and hydrogen peroxide exposure were also studied. Fluorescent latex beads were used to assess the phagocytic function of the cells. ### results Acrolein inhibited the phagocytic function of human RPE R-50 cells, and the inhibitory effects were time dependent. Pretreatment with lutein, zeaxanthin, meclofenamic acid, or resveratrol alleviated the inhibition of phagocytosis in the acute acrolein and combined acrolein/hydrogen peroxide toxicity models. Synergistic effects were seen between zeaxanthin and resveratrol or meclofenamic acid . Cotreatment with lutein, zeaxanthin, meclofenamic acid, or resveratrol showed a protective effect against the damage caused by 7-day acrolein exposure followed by hydrogen peroxide treatment. ### conclusions Our results indicated an inhibitory effect of compounds found in cigarette smoke on human RPE phagocytosis, and lutein, zeaxanthin, meclofenamic acid, and resveratrol each offered protection against this inhibition. Therefore, red wine polyphenol, resveratrol, might ameliorate acrolein-induced or age-related RPE degeneration, such as AMD.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20565308/"}

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. In this way they might influence whether a cell is sensitive or resistant to a certain drug. So far, only a limited number of relatively small scale studies comprising few cell lines and/or drugs have been performed. To obtain a broader view on miRNAs and their association with drug response, we investigated the expression levels of 411 miRNAs in relation to drug sensitivity in 36 breast cancer cell lines. For this purpose IC50 values of a drug screen involving 34 drugs were associated with miRNA expression data of the same breast cancer cell lines. Since molecular subtype of the breast cancer cell lines is considered a confounding factor in drug association studies, multivariate analysis taking subtype into account was performed on significant miRNA-drug associations which retained 13 associations. These associations consisted of 11 different miRNAs and eight different drugs (among which paclitaxel, docetaxel and veliparib). The taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, were the only drugs having miRNAs in common: hsa-miR-187-5p and hsa-miR-106a-3p indicative of drug resistance while paclitaxel sensitivity alone associated with hsa-miR-556-5p. tivantinib was associated with hsa-let-7d-5p and hsa-miR-18a-5p for sensitivity and hsa-miR-637 for resistance.

By doing so hsa-miR-187-5p was linked to the cell cycle G2-M checkpoint in line with this checkpoint being the target of taxanes.

Preclinical data suggest synergy between olaparib and androgen pathway inhibitors. We aimed to assess the efficacy of olaparib plus the androgen pathway inhibitor abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer regardless of HRR mutation status. ### methods We carried out this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 41 urological oncology sites in 11 countries across Europe and North America. Eligible male patients were aged 18 years or older with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had previously received docetaxel and were candidates for abiraterone treatment. Patients were excluded if they had received more than two previous lines of chemotherapy, or had previous exposure to second-generation antihormonal drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice or web response system, without stratification, to receive oral olaparib 300 mg twice daily or placebo. All patients received oral abiraterone 1000 mg once daily and prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS; based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria). Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients, and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of olaparib or placebo. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01972217, and is no longer recruiting patients. ### findings Between Nov 25, 2014, and July 14, 2015, 171 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 142 patients were randomly assigned to receive olaparib and abiraterone (n=71) or placebo and abiraterone (n=71). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Sept 22, 2017. Median rPFS was 13\u00b78 months (95% CI 10\u00b78-20\u00b74) with olaparib and abiraterone and 8\u00b72 months (5\u00b75-9\u00b77) with placebo and abiraterone (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b765, 95% CI 0\u00b744-0\u00b797, p=0\u00b7034). The most common grade 1-2 adverse events were nausea (26 [37%] patients in the olaparib group vs 13 [18%] patients in the placebo group), constipation (18 [25%] vs eight [11%]), and back pain (17 [24%] vs 13 [18%]). 38 (54%) of 71 patients in the olaparib and abiraterone group and 20 (28%) of 71 patients in the placebo and abiraterone group had grade 3 or worse adverse events, including anaemia (in 15 [21%] of 71 patients vs none of 71), pneumonia (four [6%] vs three [4%]), and myocardial infarction (four [6%] vs none). Serious adverse events were reported by 24 ( 34 % ) of 71 patients receiving olaparib and abiraterone ( seven of which were related to treatment ) and 13 ( 18 % ) of 71 patients receiving placebo and abiraterone ( one of which was related to treatment ) . One treatment-related death (pneumonitis) occurred in the olaparib and abiraterone group. ### interpretation olaparib in combination with abiraterone provided clinical efficacy benefit for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer compared with abiraterone alone. More serious adverse events were observed in patients who received olaparib and abiraterone than abiraterone alone. Our data suggest that the combination of olaparib and abiraterone might provide an additional clinical benefit to a broad population of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. ### funding AstraZeneca.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29880291/"}

Adimolol was compared with propranolol, labetalol, prazosin and combinations of propranolol plus low-dose prazosin. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, labetalol, propranolol plus low-dose prazosin and adimolol lowered blood pressure considerably in parallel with heart rate. propranolol alone acutely lowered heart rate, but not blood pressure. Low-dose prazosin alone lowered blood pressure and heart rate only moderately. In autoperfused hindquarters , the pressor-response curve to noradrenaline was dose-dependently shifted to the left by propranolol and to the right by labetalol or prazosin . The leftward shift by propranolol could be antagonized dose-dependently by addition of low doses of prazosin. Adimolol, at doses of 0.1, 10 and 20 mg/kg, did not significantly influence the pressor-response curve to noradrenaline in this model, whereas a slight but significant shift to the left was observed with 1 mg/kg. In summary, the cardiovascular effects of adimolol in rats cannot completely be explained by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. They can be mimicked by the concomitant administration of a beta-adrenoceptor blocking and an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent. We conclude that the alpha-adrenolytic activity of adimolol can be demonstrated in vivo and may contribute to the blood pressure lowering action of the compound in rats.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2576194/"}

Cancer patients undergoing treatment with systemic cancer chemotherapy drugs often have abnormal growth factor and cytokine profiles. Thus, serum levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8) are elevated in patients with malignant melanoma. In addition to IL-8, aggressive melanoma cells secrete, through its transcriptional regulator hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis and metastasis of human cancerous cells. Whether these responses are related to adenosine, a ubiquitous mediator expressed at high concentrations in cancer and implicated in numerous inflammatory processes, is not known and is the focus of this study. We have examined whether the DNA-damaging agents etoposide ( VP-16 ) and doxorubicin can affect IL-8 , VEGF , and HIF-1 expressions in human melanoma cancer cells . In particular, we have investigated whether these responses are related to the modulation of the adenosine receptor subtypes, namely, A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3). We have demonstrated that A(2B) receptor blockade can impair IL-8 production, whereas blocking A(3) receptors, it is possible to further decrease VEGF secretion in melanoma cells treated with VP-16 and doxorubicin. This understanding may present the possibility of using adenosine antagonists to reduce chemotherapy-induced inflammatory cytokine production and to improve the ability of chemotherapeutic drugs to block angiogenesis. Consequently, we conclude that adenosine receptor modulation may be useful for refining the use of chemotherapeutic drugs to treat human cancer more effectively.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19794965/"}

Patients were randomly divided into two groups: one received tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg (Group 1, 200 patients) and the other tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg plus meloxicam 15 mg (Group 2, 200 patients) prospectively. Patients were evaluated for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms according to the American Urological Association clinical guidelines and sleep quality according to Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

In rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) of childhood and adolescence very little is known about interactions of cytotoxic drugs and tumor cells. In recurrent RMS the tumor cells are often more mature than in the primary tumor. The biological properties of these cells are still a subject of controversy. We investigated two human ( RD2 and TE 671 ) cell lines by cultivating them with doxorubicin , cisplatinum , and etoposide . Degree of differentiation and proliferation rate were estimated morphologically and by means of immunohistochemistry and a monolayer proliferation assay. Both morphological and immunohistochemical maturation was measurable in most resistant cell lines. An increase in myosin expression was most marked in the etoposide- and doxorubicin-resistant RD cell lines. The proliferation rate was decreased in almost all resistant cell lines. Nevertheless, the resistant cell lines tolerated high-dose levels of cytotoxic drugs at a higher proliferation rate than parental cell lines cultivated under similar conditions. The maturation seen in some recurrent tumors of RMS can be simulated in vitro by cultivating cell lines with cytotoxic drugs at sublethal doses. Interestingly, the resistance-associated induced maturation was not accompanied by p170 expression.

In the case of gastric cancer, there is little or no involvement of P-glycoprotein, and the mechanisms of MDR remain to be understood.

This therapeutic strategy has become the standard strategy during the following 8 years. However, this therapy still has room for improvement. One of the important drawbacks of intravenous thrombolysis is the limited therapeutic time window. On the basis of the results of the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study III and the pooled analysis, the current time window is within 4.5 h of stroke onset. The window may be extended to 6 h or longer, probably by appropriate determination of the eligibility of a patient for receiving therapy by using penumbral imaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)/perfusion-weighted imaging mismatch and DWI/magnetic resonance imaging mismatch. Newer-generation recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activators , such as desmoteplase and tenecteplase , will also help extend the time window . Patients with wake-up and unclear-onset strokes are generally ineligible for thrombolysis; therefore, the optimal therapeutic strategy for such patients should be established.

This paper describes in vivo binding, kinetics and pharmacology of a highly potent 18F-labeled analog of epibatidine, (+/-)-exo-2-(2-[18F]fluoro-5-pyridyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane ([18F]FPH), in the mouse brain with the view towards application of this tracer for PET imaging of nAChR in human brain. ### methods Fluorine-18-FPH was administered intravenously to mice, and time-activity curves were determined for several regions in the brain and other organs. Saturation and pharmacology of [18F]FPH binding was demonstrated in vivo by preinjecting unlabeled FPH or other drugs with known pharmacological action before [18F]FPH was injected. The effect of the drugs on [18F]FPH accumulation was evaluated. ### results [18F]FPH was rapidly incorporated into the mouse brain; peak activity (2.4% of the injected dose) was measured at 5 min after intravenous administration, followed by washout to 1.1% injected dose (ID) at 60 min. Highest concentrations of 18F occurred at 15 min in areas known to contain high densities of nAChR \u00bfe.g., thalamus [9.7% of injected dose per gram tissue (ID/g\u00bf] and superior colliculus (8.3% ID/g)]. Accumulation of the 18F tracer in hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and cortical areas was intermediate (5.0, 5.6, 4.2 and 5.6% ID/g, respectively) and low in the cerebellum (2.8% ID/g). The distribution of [18F]FPH in the mouse brain matched that of other in vivo nAChR probes such as 3H-labeled epibatidine or norchloroepibatidine, [3H](-)-nicotine and [3H]cytisine and that of nAChR densities determined in postmortem autoradiographic studies in rodents. Preinjection of blocking doses of unlabeled epibatidine , (-)-nicotine , lobeline and cytisine significantly inhibited [18F]FPH binding in thalamus and superior colliculus , but not in cerebellum , whereas drugs that interact with binding sites other than acetylcholine recognition sites of nAChR ( e.g. , mecamylamine , scopolamine , N-methylspiperone and ketanserin ) had no effect on [18F]FPH accumulation in any of the brain regions examined . ### conclusion Fluorine-18-FPH labels nAChR in vivo in the mouse brain.

Recent studies have prompted an anti-tumor effect of aspirin. Here, we demonstrated that aspirin not only inhibits the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7, especially when combined with tamoxifen, but also has a potential function to overcome tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7/TAM. aspirin combined with tamoxifen can down regulate cyclinD1 and block cell cycle in G0/G1 phase. Besides, tamoxifen alone represses c-myc, progesterone receptor (PR) and cyclinD1 in MCF-7 cell line but not in MCF-7/TAM, while aspirin combined with tamoxifen can inhibit the expression of these proteins in the resistant cell line. When knocking down c-myc in MCF-7/TAM, cells become more sensitive to tamoxifen, cell cycle is blocked as well, indicating that aspirin can regulate c-myc and cyclinD1 proteins to overcome tamoxifen resistance. Our study discovered a novel role of aspirin based on its anti-tumor effect, and put forward some kinds of possible mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer cells, providing a new strategy for the treatment of ER-positive breast carcinoma.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28415819/"}

To build on this therapy, we have evaluated the combination of irinotecan given on this schedule with 5-fluorouracil given on days 1, 7, and 14 with or without leucovorin [(dx5)3 i.v.] against colon tumors, or combined with etoposide administered (dx5)2 i.v. either 2 h before or 2 h after irinotecan for treatment of colon tumors and rhabdomyosarcomas. A combination of 5-fluorouracil at 75% and irinotecan at 50% of their respective maximum tolerated doses when administered as single agents on this schedule gave acceptable toxicity. Against colon adenocarcinoma xenografts, 5-fluorouracil did not enhance the response rate compared with that obtained with the optimum dose of irinotecan given as a single agent.

Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), which frequently arises in the oral cavity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients. PBL shows diffuse proliferation of large neoplastic cells resembling B-immunoblasts/plasmablasts, or with plasmacytic features and an immunophenotype of plasma cells. PBL remains a diagnostic challenge due to its peculiar morphology and an immunohistochemical profile similar to plasma cell myeloma (PCM). PBL is also a therapeutic challenge with a clinical course characterized by a high rate of relapse and death. There is no standard chemotherapy protocol for treatment of PBL. Cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone ( CHOP ) or CHOP-like regimens have been the backbone while more intensive regimens such as cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , high-dose methotrexate/ifosfamide , etoposide , high-dose cytarabine ( CODOX-M/IVAC ) , or dose-adjusted etoposide , prednisone , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , and doxorubicin ( DA-EPOCH ) are possible options . Recently, a few studies have reported the potential value of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and thalidomide in PBL patients. The introduction of genes encoding artificial receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and CAR-modified T cells targeted to the B cell-specific CD19 antigen have demonstrated promising results in multiple early clinical trials.

Two authors drew the details of trial design, characteristics of patients, outcomes, and toxicity from the studies included. Data analysis was performed by RevMan 4.2. ### results According to the screening criteria, 7 clinical studies with 2095 participants of advanced colorectal cancer were included in this meta analysis. The baseline characteristics of irinotecan group were similar to those of oxaliplatin group. The response rate of oxaliplatin group was higher than that of irinotecan group (relative risk (RR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) (0.70, 0.96), P = 0.01), and the median overall survival of oxaliplatin group was longer by 2.04 months than that of irinotecan group (95%CI (-3.54, -0.54), P = 0.008).

Resistance to cytotoxic agents has long been known to be a major limitation in the treatment of human cancers. Although many mechanisms of drug resistance have been identified, chemotherapies targeting known mechanisms have failed to lead to effective reversal of drug resistance, suggesting that alternative mechanisms remain undiscovered. Previous work identified midkine (MK) as a novel putative survival molecule responsible for cytoprotective signaling between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma and breast carcinoma cells in vitro. In the present study, we provide further in vitro and in vivo studies supporting the role of MK in neuroblastoma cytoprotection. MK overexpressing wild type neuroblastoma cells exhibit a cytoprotective effect on wild type cells when grown in a co-culture system, similar to that seen with doxorubicin resistant cells. siRNA knockdown of MK expression in doxorubicin resistant neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma cells ameliorates this protective effect. Overexpression of MK in wild type neuroblastoma cells leads to acquired drug resistance to doxorubicin and to the related drug etoposide . Mouse studies injecting various ratios of doxorubicin resistant or MK transfected cells with GFP transfected wild type cells confirm this cytoprotective effect in vivo. These findings provide additional evidence for the existence of intercellular cytoprotective signals mediated by MK which contribute to chemotherapy resistance in neuroblastoma.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24083030/"}

This increase was significant in trials that did not randomise participants to an inhaled corticosteroid, but less certain in the smaller numbers of participants in trials that included an inhaled corticosteroid in the randomised treatment regimen. ### objectives we set out to compare the risks of mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials which have randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular formoterol versus regular salmeterol, when each are used with an inhaled corticosteroid as part of the randomised treatment ### Search Strategy trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Manufacturers' web sites of clinical trial registers were checked for unpublished trial data and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol and salmeterol were also checked. The date of the most recent search was July 2009. ### Selection Criteria controlled clinical trials with a parallel design, recruiting patients of any age and severity of asthma were included if they randomised patients to treatment with regular formoterol versus regular salmeterol (each with a randomised inhaled corticosteroid), and were of at least 12 weeks duration. ### Data Collection And Analysis two authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review and extracted outcome data. Unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events were sought from the sponsors and authors. ### Main Results eight studies met the eligibility criteria of the review recruiting 6,163 adults and adolescents. There were seven studies (involving 5,935 adults and adolescents) comparing formoterol and budesonide to salmeterol and fluticasone. All but one study administered the products as a combined inhaler, and most used formoterol 50 mcg and budesonide 400 mcg twice daily versus salmeterol 50 mcg and fluticasone 250 mcg twice daily. There were two deaths overall (one on each combination) and neither were thought to be related to asthma. There was no significant difference between treatment groups for non-fatal serious adverse events, either all-cause (Peto OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.59, I2 = 26%) or asthma-related (Peto OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.26, I2 = 33%). Over 23 weeks the rates for all-cause serious adverse events were 2.6% on formoterol and budesonide and 2.3% on salmeterol and fluticasone, and for asthma-related serious adverse events, 0.6% and 0.8% respectively. There was one study (228 adults) comparing formoterol and beclomethasone to salmeterol and fluticasone, but there were no deaths or hospital admissions. No studies were found in children. ### Authors Conclusions the seven identified studies in adults did not show any significant difference in safety between formoterol and budesonide in comparison with salmeterol and fluticasone. Asthma-related serious adverse events were rare, and there were no reported asthma-related deaths. There was a single small study comparing formoterol and beclomethasone to salmeterol and fluticasone in adults, but no serious adverse events occurred in this study. No studies were found in children. Overall there is insufficient evidence to decide whether regular formoterol and budesonide or beclomethasone have equivalent or different safety profiles from salmeterol and fluticasone.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21181075/"}

However, the treatment patterns of each drug in real-world clinical practice, as opposed to the controlled environment of a trial, have not been directly compared. ### objective To compare persistence and compliance (adherence) with pazopanib versus sunitinib in a real-world setting. ### methods This was a retrospective claims analysis using 2 databases: Optum Research Database and Impact National Benchmark Database. Eligible patients included adult patients (aged \u2265 18 years) with \u2265 2 RCC diagnoses and evidence of first-line therapy with \u2265 1 subsequent pharmacy claim for pazopanib or sunitinib between October 2009 and July 2012. The date of the first pazopanib or sunitinib claim was defined as the index date. Additional requirements included continuous enrollment in the health plan for 2 months prior (baseline period) through 6 months after (follow-up period) the index date and no cancers other than those associated with RCC. Propensity score matching was used to minimize selection bias. Persistence with the index drug was compared using days to discontinuation, estimated level of persistence (ELPT) at 180 days, and proportion of days covered (PDC). PDC was defined by dividing the number of days covered with the index drug by the number of follow-up days. Compliance was estimated using medication possession ratio (MPR). For matched cohort pairs with > 1 fill, MPR was defined by dividing the number of days covered with the index drug by the number of days between the first and last index medication fill. ### results We identified 84 matched pairs among 97 patients prescribed pazopanib and 349 prescribed sunitinib. Among the matched population, mean comorbidity index score was 5.8 (95% CI = 1.8-6.0) for pazopanib, and 6.1 (95% CI =1.8-6.0) for sunitinib (P = 0.133). Evidence of any radiation therapy during the baseline period was significantly higher among the sunitinib cohort prior to matching (9% vs. 18%, P = 0.043), and evidence of surgery was higher in the pazopanib cohort after matching (12% vs. 7%, P = 0.046). Cohorts were balanced according to demographic and clinical characteristics with mean (SD) age of 63.0 (9.0) years and 77.4% male. During the 6-month period after drug initiation, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) by drug cohort in the duration of index drug therapy or the percentage of patients who discontinued their index drugs. The mean (SD) time to discontinuation was 133.4 (62.8) days and 139.9 (55.6) days among the matched pazopanib and sunitinib cohorts, respectively (P = 0.445). In both cohorts , more than 40 % of patients discontinued their index drugs ( 46.4 % pazopanib and 44.1 % sunitinib , P = 0.732 ) . In addition, there was no significant difference by drug cohort in the ELPT at any time examined between 30 and 180 days after initiation of therapy. PDC with the index drug during the fixed 6-month follow-up was also examined. Although the mean PDC was significantly higher among the sunitinib cohort (0.77 vs. 0.68 for pazopanib, P = 0.037), there was no difference by cohort in the percentage of patients with high PDC (defined as \u2265 80%): 52.4% versus 56.0% for pazopanib and sunitinib, respectively (P = 0.622).

Outcomes were adjusted with the use of a propensity score to account for differences in patient characteristics and illness severity between groups. ### results A total of 216 patients were treated with ceftriaxone plus doxycycline and 125 received other appropriate initial empiric antibiotic therapies. After adjustment, use of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline was associated with reduced inpatient mortality (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08-0.81) and 30-day mortality (OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.17-0.81), but not with length of stay or readmission rates. Analysis of a subset of the sample that excluded patients admitted from nursing homes, patients admitted to the ICU, and patients diagnosed with aspiration also showed reduced inpatient mortality with the use of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline. ### conclusions The use of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline as an initial empiric therapy for patients hospitalized with CAP appears safe and effective , and its potential superiority should be evaluated prospectively .", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17219465/"}

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) an incretin hormone, is known to regulate the glucose-mediated insulin secretion. However, reduction in the level of GLP-1 is considered to be a major cause for the reduction of GLP-1-dependent insulin secretory response. genistein an isoflavone, is an important polyphenol and has wide range of therapeutic potentials, but its therapeutic effects alone and/or in combination with metformin on GLP-1 secretion have not been investigated yet. Hence, we aimed to investigate the stimulatory action of genistein in combination with metformin on GLP-1 via downregulation of inflammatory mediators, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in experimental rats by single administration of alloxan intraperitoneally. Metformin ( 50 mg/kg/day ) , genistein ( 20 mg/kg/day ) and combination of genistein and metformin was administered in alloxan-induced diabetic rats . We found that genistein alone and/or in combination with metformin significantly increased the serum level (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and tissue content (P\u2009<\u20090.05) of GLP-1 in intestine when compared with that of metformin-treated animals. Similarly, genistein alone and/or in combination with metformin also resulted in normoglycemia (P\u2009<\u20090.001), glucose tolerance (P\u2009<\u20090.01), insulin sensitivity (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), hyperlipidemia (P\u2009<\u20090.01), liver and kidney function biomarkers (P\u2009<\u20090.01) as compared to that of metformin-treated experimental animals. Moreover, genistein alone and/or in combination with metformin also downregulated the inflammatory responses by decreasing the levels of interleuin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and C-reactive protein in serum (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and intestine (P\u2009<\u20090.001) more efficiently as compared to that of metformin-treated experimental animals. The downregulation of inflammatory responses in intestine, was positively associated with increased secretion of GLP-1 from intestine. Histopathology of pancreas and intestine also showed that genistein significantly improved the deleterious effects of alloxan on pancreas and intestine. Hence, our work provides new insights on the synergistic effects of genistein and metformin on GLP-1 secretion.

A small series of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) studies using conventional conditioning regimens has demonstrated durable progression-free survival (PFS) rates ranging from 25% to 47%, but data in the rituximab era are lacking. Here we report the results of a multicenter retrospective trial evaluating ASCT in patients with transformed lymphoma using the Z-BEAM conditioning regimen , which combines yttrium-90-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan ( Zevalin ) with high-dose BEAM ( carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan ) chemotherapy .

In addition, infected wax moth larvae were treated with daptomycin, penicillin or vancomycin to examine whether these agents were effective against S. aureus and MRSA infections in vivo. ### results Increasing inoculum doses of live S. aureus cells resulted in greater larval mortality, but heat-killed bacteria and cell-free culture filtrates had no detrimental effects on survival.

The chimeric antibody margetuximab shares ERBB2 specificity with trastuzumab but incorporates an engineered Fc region to increase immune activation. ### objective To compare the clinical efficacy of margetuximab vs trastuzumab, each with chemotherapy, in patients with pretreated ERBB2-positive ABC. ### Design Setting And Participants The SOPHIA phase 3 randomized open-label trial of margetuximab plus chemotherapy vs trastuzumab plus chemotherapy enrolled 536 patients from August 26, 2015, to October 10, 2018, at 166 sites in 17 countries. Eligible patients had disease progression on 2 or more prior anti-ERBB2 therapies and 1 to 3 lines of therapy for metastatic disease. Data were analyzed from February 2019 to October 2019. ### interventions Investigators selected chemotherapy before 1:1 randomization to margetuximab, 15 mg/kg, or trastuzumab, 6 mg/kg (loading dose, 8 mg/kg), each in 3-week cycles. Stratification factors were metastatic sites (\u22642, >2), lines of therapy (\u22642, >2), and chemotherapy choice. ### Main Outcomes And Measures Sequential primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) by central blinded analysis and overall survival (OS). All \u03b1 was allocated to PFS, followed by OS. Secondary end points were investigator-assessed PFS and objective response rate by central blinded analysis. ### results A total of 536 patients were randomized to receive margetuximab (n\u2009=\u2009266) or trastuzumab (n\u2009=\u2009270). The median age was 56 (27-86) years; 266 (100%) women were in the margetuximab group, while 267 (98.9%) women were in the trastuzumab group. Groups were balanced. All but 1 patient had received prior pertuzumab, and 489 (91.2%) had received prior ado-trastuzumab emtansine. margetuximab improved primary PFS over trastuzumab with 24% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.98; P\u2009=\u2009.03; median, 5.8 [95% CI, 5.5-7.0] months vs 4.9 [95% CI, 4.2-5.6] months; October 10, 2018). After the second planned interim analysis of 270 deaths, median OS was 21.6 months with margetuximab vs 19.8 months with trastuzumab (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.69-1.13; P\u2009=\u2009.33; September 10, 2019), and investigator-assessed PFS showed 29% relative risk reduction favoring margetuximab (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.86; P\u2009<\u2009.001; median, 5.7 vs 4.4 months; September 10, 2019). margetuximab improved objective response rate over trastuzumab: 22% vs 16% (P\u2009=\u2009.06; October 10, 2018), and 25% vs 14% (P\u2009<\u2009.001; September 10, 2019). Incidence of infusion-related reactions, mostly in cycle 1, was higher with margetuximab (35 [13.3%] vs 9 [3.4%]); otherwise, safety was comparable. ### Conclusions And Relevance In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, margetuximab plus chemotherapy had acceptable safety and a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in ERBB2-positive ABC after progression on 2 or more prior anti-ERBB2 therapies.

In the present study, we found that the expression of microRNA-125a was decreased in laryngeal carcinoma tissues and Hep-2 laryngeal cancer stem cells (Hep-2-CSCs).

All patients were evaluated for eligibility for a compassionate 5-FU/oxaliplatin protocol. cDNA was derived from paraffin-embedded tumor specimens to determine TS and ERCC1 mRNA expression relative to the internal reference gene beta-actin using fluorescence-based, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. ### results The median TS gene expression level from 50 metastasized tumors was 3.4 x 10(-3) (minimum expression, 0.18 x 10(-3);maximum expression, 11.5 x 10(-3)), and the median ERCC1 gene expression level was 2.53 x 10(-3) (minimum, 0.0; maximum, 14.61 x 10(-3)).

Increased \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) signaling has been shown to promote the creation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Preclinical studies have shown that abrogation of this signaling pathway, particularly \u03b22-AR, provides a more favorable TME that enhances the activity of anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. We hypothesize that blocking stress-related immunosuppressive pathways would improve tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients. Here, we report the results of dose escalation of a nonselective \u03b2-blocker (propranolol) with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma. ### Patients And Methods A 3 + 3 dose escalation study for propranolol twice a day with pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) was completed. The primary objective was to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Additional objectives included safety, antitumor activity, and biomarker analyses. Responders were defined as patients with complete or partial response per immune-modified RECIST at 6 months. ### results Nine patients with metastatic melanoma received increasing doses of propranolol in cohorts of 10, 20, and 30 mg twice a day.

Plasma concentrations of vildagliptin, DPP-4, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose, insulin, and glucagon were determined from blood samples collected at steady state. ### results Exposure to vildagliptin 50 mg (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC\u03c4,ss)) and maximum plasma concentration at steady state (Cmax,ss) was reduced by 23% and 34% respectively with co-administration of voglibose. The percentage of DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin remained unchanged when vildagliptin was given alone or co-administered with voglibose; maximum inhibition was 98.3 \u00b1 1.4% (mean \u00b1 SD) for vildagliptin alone and 97.4 \u00b1 1.1% with co-administration. Coadministration of vildagliptin and voglibose led to a greater increase in the active GLP-1 plasma concentration than did vildagliptin alone (geometric mean ratio 1.63 (90% CI, 1.30, 2.03), p = 0.0007). The combination of vildagliptin and voglibose also led to a significantly lower plasma glucose levels (p < 0.0001). ### conclusions Plasma vildagliptin levels were decreased when voglibose was co-administered, although DPP- 4 inhibition remained unchanged. Co-administration led to significantly better pharmacodynamic response compared with each treatment alone, including higher active GLP-1 and lower glucose levels. The results indicate that this coadministration may be beneficial in the clinical situation. vildagliptin and voglibose treatments, alone or when co-administered, were well tolerated in Japanese patients with Type 2 diabetes.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23782587/"}

The interest in CSCs emerged from their expected role in initiation, progression and recurrence of many tumors. They are generally resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There are two hypotheses about their origin: The first assumes that CSCs may arise from normal stem cells, and the second supposes that differentiated cells acquire the properties of CSCs. Both hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, as it is possible that CSCs have a diverse origin in different tumors. CD133 + cells ( CD133 is marker of CSC in some tumors ) isolated from NBL , osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma cell lines are resistant to cisplatin , carboplatin , etoposide and doxorubicin than the CD133- ones .

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most deadly cancers worldwide, with poor prognosis once the disease has progressed past the point at which surgery is a viable option. Whilst chemotherapy has improved survival over recent decades, there is still great need for improvements in treatments for patients with advanced disease. Over the last decade, a variety of such drugs have received market approval for treating NSCLC, with a variety of others in the pipeline. Here, we review the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC, including those already in clinical practice and those in early trials. The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitors , gefitinib , erlotinib and afatinib ; the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) inhibitor , crizotinib ; and the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , are already providing improved survival for patients with NSCLC . Moreover, the discovery of EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements has enabled the identification of patients who are more likely to benefit from a specific drug. The recent approval of the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, along with the designation of alectinib and MPDL3280A as breakthrough therapies by the FDA, demonstrates how rapidly this area of research is expanding. Over the last decade there has been significant progress made in the treatment of advanced NSCLC, and the large and varied selection of drugs currently undergoing trials provide great promise for improving the prognosis of this highly prevalent and deadly form of cancer.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26537995/"}

Depending on context and tumor stage, deregulation of autophagy can either suppress tumorigenesis or promote chemoresistance and tumor survival. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) can modulate autophagy; however, the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Here , we analyze the effects of the broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors ( HDACi ) panobinostat and vorinostat on the transcriptional regulation of autophagy with respect to autophagy transcription factor activity ( Transcription factor EB-TFEB , forkhead boxO-FOXO ) and autophagic flux in neuroblastoma cells . In combination with the late-stage autophagic flux inhibitor bafilomycin A1, HDACis increase the number of autophagic vesicles, indicating an increase in autophagic flux. Both HDACi induce nuclear translocation of the transcription factors FOXO1 and FOXO3a, but not TFEB and promote the expression of pro-autophagic FOXO1/3a target genes. Moreover, FOXO1/3a knockdown experiments impaired HDACi treatment mediated expression of autophagy related genes. Combination of panobinostat with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine, which blocks autophagic flux, enhances neuroblastoma cell death in culture and hampers tumor growth in vivo in a neuroblastoma zebrafish xenograft model. In conclusion, our results indicate that pan-HDACi treatment induces autophagy in neuroblastoma at a transcriptional level.

The ischemia was produced by neck tourniquet in combination with hypotension (50-60 mmHg). Blood flow was measured by hydrogen-clearance method. Transient reactive hyperemia was observed immediately after the cessation of ischemic procedure, and was followed by a decrease in blood flow in the range of 58-73% of corresponding basal values in the total brain, cortex and thalamus.

Neurohypophysial hormone levels were measured by specific radioimmunoassay in trunk blood samples taken 48 h after the saline or water treatment. The AV3V-lesioned group of animals were characterized by an inability to excrete the excess sodium load and by a failure to increase secretion of both oxytocin and vasopressin into the general circulation in response to the salt-stimulus .

Preincubation with the reduced glutathione (GSH) synthesis inhibitor l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) always potentiated peroxide accumulation. However, although GSH depletion potentiated the toxicity of cisplatin and melphalan, occasionally switching the mode of death from apoptosis to necrosis, it did not affect the toxicity of the other antitumor drugs. Hypoxia or preincubation with antioxidant agents attenuated death induction, apoptotic and necrotic, by alkylating drugs. The generation of necrosis by cisplatin could not be mimicked by addition of exogenous H(2)O(2) instead of BSO and was not adequately explained by caspase inactivation nor by a selective fall in ATP content. Treatment with cisplatin and melphalan caused a late decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim), which was much greater during necrosis than during apoptosis. The administration of the antioxidant agents N-acetyl-l-cysteine and butylated hydroxyanisole after pulse treatment with cisplatin or melphalan did not affect apoptosis but attenuated necrosis.

The three microcirculation patterns of endothelium-dependent vessels, mosaic vessels and vasculogenic mimicry were counted. The activity of MMP-2, MMP-9 between different groups was examined by gelatin zymography. ### results Tumor growth in the three experimental groups was statistically significantly slower than that in the control group. The expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 in each treated group was significantly different with that in the control group. The amount of three microcirculation patterns in three experimental groups was less than that of the control group, and the amount of MV and VM in each experimental group was significantly less than that in the control group.

However, also the development of new preclinical ACC models has remained a challenge with only one human cell line (NCI-H295R) and one recently established human pediatric xenograft model (SJ-ACC3) being available for this highly heterogeneous malignancy.

In an attempt to broaden the current preclinical armamentarium, we aimed at the development of patient-individual tumor models. During these studies, one xenograft (MUC-1) displayed marked engraftment and sustained tumor growth. MUC-1 tumor analysis revealed highly vascularized, proliferating and SF-1 positive xenografts. In a next step, we characterized all currently available human tumor models for ACC for Ki67, SF-1 and EGF-receptor status in comparison with MUC-1-xenografts.

A range of new treatment options has recently become available for patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone is continued when performing chemotherapy or androgen deprivation with new second-generation therapeutic agents such as enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate. Despite the fact that free testosterone (FT) is the biologically active form, it is common practice that androgen suppression is monitored via total testosterone levels only. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of FT as a prognostic biomarker for cancer-specific survival (CSS) and its feasibility as an ADT monitoring biomarker in patients with mCRPC for the first time. The requirement for continued ADT in mCRPC patients is discussed within the basis of the current literature. A total of 34 patients with continuous measurements of FT levels and mCRPC status underwent therapy with docetaxel , abiraterone acetate , enzalutamide , cabozantinib , carboplatin or cabazitaxel . Data were obtained from the Departments of Urology and Urological Oncology, Hannover Medical School (Hannover, Germany) between March 2009 and April 2014. A cutoff point of 0.5 pg/ml was used to discriminate between patients according to FT levels. Statistical evaluation of CSS was performed by applying Kaplan Meier survival estimates, multivariate Cox regression analyses and log-rank tests. The median age of all 34 patients was 72 years (range, 51-86 years). The mean follow-up interval was 16.1 months (range, 0.7-55.6 months). Despite the fact that all patients were undergoing androgen deprivation, the mean serum FT levels for each patient varied; the mean FT concentration in the cohort was 0.328 pg/ml, ranging from 0.01-9.1 pg/ml. A notable difference with regard to CSS was observed for patients with regard to serum FT concentration; CSS was significantly longer for patients with a serum FT level below the cutoff level (43.6 vs. 17.3 months, respectively, P=0.0063). Upon multivariate Cox regression analysis, the mean FT concentration during treatment remained a significant prognostic factor for CSS (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.43; P=0.0182). In conclusion, in patients with mCRPC, the serum FT level is a strong predictor of CSS in patients under therapy with second-line anti-hormonal therapeutic medication and chemotherapy. It may be concluded that FT levels should be included into the routine control of androgen suppression while under treatment with ADT and second-generation hormonal therapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28123517/"}

Pharmacological interventions with a proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) , H2 receptor antagonist ( H2RA ) , antacid , bismuth and sucralfate may have effects on both the prevention and treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in infants . ### objectives To assess how different pharmacological interventions (PPIs, H2RAs, antacids, sucralfate or bismuth salts) administered to preterm and term neonates for the prevention or treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding to reduce morbidity and mortality compare with placebo or no treatment, supportive care, or each other. ### Search Methods We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 6), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 12 July 2018), Embase (1980 to 12 July 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 12 July 2018). We also searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials, and online for Chinese literature articles. ### Selection Criteria We selected randomised, quasi-randomised and cluster-randomised trials involving preterm and term neonates. Trials were included if they used a proton pump inhibitor, H2 receptor antagonist, antacid, sucralfate or bismuth either for the prevention or treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. ### Data Collection And Analysis Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We conducted meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. We used the GRADE approach to assess quality of evidence. ### Main Results Eleven studies with 818 infants met the criteria for inclusion in this review.Four trials with 329 infants assessed the use of an H2 receptor antagonist for prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in high-risk newborn infants. Meta-analysis of these four trials identified a reduction in any upper gastrointestinal bleeding when using an H2 receptor antagonist (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.58; typical risk difference (RD) -0.20, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.11; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5, 95% CI 4 to 9). The quality of evidence was moderate. A single trial with 53 infants assessing prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding reported no difference in mortality in infants assigned H2 receptor antagonist versus no treatment; however the quality of evidence was very low.Seven trials with 489 infants assessed an inhibitor of gastric acid (H2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor) for treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding in newborn infants. Meta-analysis of two trials (131 infants) showed no difference in mortality from use of a H2 receptor antagonist compared to no treatment. The quality of evidence was low. Meta-analysis of two trials (104 infants) showed a reduction in duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding from use of an inhibitor of gastric acid compared to no treatment (mean difference -1.06 days, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.84). The quality of evidence was very low. Meta-analysis of six trials (451 infants) showed a reduction in continued upper gastrointestinal bleeding from use of any inhibitor of gastric acid compared to no treatment (typical RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.49; typical RD -0.26, 95% CI -0.33, -0.19; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). The quality of evidence was low. There were no significant subgroup differences in duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or of continued upper gastrointestinal bleeding according to type of inhibitor of gastric acid. A single trial (38 infants) reported no difference in anaemia requiring blood transfusion from use of a H2 receptor antagonist compared to no treatment.Although no serious adverse events were reported from the use of a H2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor, some neonatal morbidities - including necrotising enterocolitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, duration of ventilation and respiratory support, and duration of hospital stay - were not reported. Long-term outcome was not reported. ### Authors Conclusions There is moderate-quality evidence that use of an H2 receptor antagonist reduces the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in newborn infants at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. There is low-quality evidence that use of an inhibitor of gastric acid (H2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor) reduces the duration of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the incidence of continued gastric bleeding in newborn infants with gastrointestinal bleeding. However, there is no evidence that use of an inhibitor of gastric acid in newborn infants affects mortality or the need for blood transfusion. As no study reported the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, ventilator- or hospital-associated pneumonia, sepsis, or long-term outcome, the safety of inhibitors of gastric acid secretion is unclear.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31265739/"}

Spontaneously arising K14cre;Brca1(F/F) ;p53(F/F) mouse mammary tumors were orthotopically implanted in syngeneic mice lacking Cyp3a (Cyp3a(-/-)) to limit ritonavir effects on systemic docetaxel clearance. Over 3 weeks, docetaxel (20 mg/kg) was administered intravenously once weekly, with or without ritonavir (12.5 mg/kg) administered orally for 5 days per week. Untreated mice were used as control for tumor growth. ritonavir treatment alone did not significantly affect the median time of survival (14 vs. 10 days). Median time of survival in docetaxel-treated mice was 54 days. ritonavir co-treatment significantly increased this to 66 days, and substantially reduced relative average tumor size, without altering tumor histology. Concentrations of the major docetaxel metabolite M2 in tumor tissue were reduced by ritonavir co-administration, whereas tumor RNA expression of Cyp3a was unaltered. In this breast cancer model, we observed no direct antitumor effect of ritonavir alone, but we found enhanced efficacy of docetaxel treatment when combined with ritonavir. Our data, therefore, suggest that decreased docetaxel metabolism inside the tumor as a result of Cyp3a inhibition contributes to increased antitumor activity.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26297509/"}

Initial randomized clinical trials showed a lower incidence of acute rejection in tacrolimus than in cyclosporine-treated patients, in combination with steroids and azathioprine. But in conjunction with mycophenolate mofetil, the difference in the incidence of acute rejection episodes is less clear. In general, short- and medium-term outcome variables (1-year serum creatinine, graft and patient survival) with cyclosporine and tacrolimus are excellent, and (almost) identical, with both substances having the same intrinsic nephrotoxic potential.

We investigated the impact of three medications on blood Treg frequency in vaccinated cancer patients. ### Experimental Design To date, the most specific marker for human Tregs is demethylation in the DNA that encodes the transcription factor FOXP3. Thus, we used a FOXP3 methylation-specific quantitative PCR assay (MS-qPCR) to measure Treg frequencies in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of melanoma patients.

As a positive control, a more than 2-fold increase in blood Tregs was detected in four out of nine patients who were treated with interleukin-2. ### conclusions We used a MS-qPCR method that detects Tregs but not other activated T lymphocytes; however, none of the Treg-depleting strategies that we tested led, in the majority of patients, to a conservative 50% reduction in blood Tregs.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21177412/"}

We treated mice with a mixture of five antibiotics to deplete host microbiota and examined CVB3 replication and pathogenesis following oral inoculation. We found that, as seen with poliovirus, CVB3 shedding and pathogenesis were reduced in antibiotic-treated mice. While treatment with just two antibiotics, vancomycin and ampicillin, was sufficient to reduce CVB3 replication and pathogenesis, this treatment had no effect on poliovirus.

Patients ( n = 28 ) with metastatic solid tumors were randomized to receive pretreatment with Dex or GM-CSF or no pretreatment prior to courses 1 or 2 of carboplatin and ifosfamide . No alteration in dose of chemotherapy was allowed between course 1 and 2. Alterations of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity and selected biologic parameters were compared between courses 1 and 2. Patients without any pretreatment demonstrated worsening hematologic toxicity in course 2 compared to course 1. In contrast, Dex pretreatment reduced hematopoietic toxicity and improved the absolute granulocyte count (AGC) and platelet count recovery times. For example, course 1 versus course 2 (with Dex pretreatment): AGC nadir (mm3) 153 versus 549 (p = 0.07), days AGC <500/mm3 7.8 versus 4.0 (p = 0.10), days to AGC recovery >1,500/mm3, 26 versus 22 (p = 0.034). Overall comparison between all five cohorts by analyses of variance demonstrated that intervention with Dex improved multiple hematopoietic toxicities, including AGC nadir (p = 0.015), and recovery times to AGC >1,500/mm3 (p = 0.07) and platelet count to >100,000/mm3 (p = 0.05).

Cells were continuously exposed to both drugs at a constant molar ratio for 4-5 days. Combination effects were analyzed using the Median Effect method. Statistical significance was inferred if the 95% confidence interval for the combination interaction (C.I.) values for a particular two-drug combination did not include 1.0 (additivity). Synergy was inferred for C.I. values<1.0 and antagonism for CI values>1.0. ### results Imexon was synergistic when combined with DNA-binding agents (cisplatin, dacarbazine, melphalan) and pyrimidine-based antimetabolites (cytarabine, fluorouracil, gemcitabine) in both cell lines. Antagonistic combinations with imexon included methotrexate and the topoisomerase I (TOPO I) and II (TOPO II) inhibitors irinotecan, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and etoposide. docetaxel was synergistic with imexon in both cell lines whereas paclitaxel and fludarabine showed a mixed result. dexamethasone and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib showed synergy in myeloma cells and additivity in the melanoma cells. The vinca alkaloid , vinorelbine , and the multi-targeted antifol , pemetrexed , were additive with imexon in both cell lines . ### discussion The consistent synergy seen for imexon and alkylating agents may relate to the sulfhydryl-lowering effect of imexon, which would render cells more sensitive to electrophilic species from the alkylators. The marked synergy noted with pyrimidine-based antimetabolites was unexpected and may relate to the induction of cell cycle arrest in S-phase. The strong antagonism noted for imexon with topoisomerase I and II inhibitors may be due to the effect of imexon at increasing oxidant levels which are known to antagonize the cytotoxic effects of topoisomerase poisons. In contrast, the synergy seen with bortezomib in myeloma cells may be related to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) from both drugs. These results suggest that combinations of imexon with alkylating agents and pyrimidine-based antimetabolites are rational to pursue in therapeutic studies in vivo.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17333195/"}

Concern about the risk of upper genital tract infection (pelvic inflammatory disease) often limits use of the IUD, a highly effective contraceptive. Prophylactic antibiotic administration around the time of induced abortion significantly reduces the risk of postoperative endometritis.(Sawaya, 1996) Since the risk of IUD-related infection is limited to the first few weeks to months after insertion,(Lee, 1983; Farley, 1992) contamination of the endometrial cavity at the time of insertion(Mishell, 1966) appears to be the mechanism, rather than the IUD or string itself. Thus, antibiotic administration before IUD insertion might reduce the risk of upper genital tract infection from passive introduction of bacteria at insertion. ### objectives To assess the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic administration before IUD insertion in reducing IUD-related complications and discontinuations within three months of insertion. The primary outcome was pelvic inflammatory disease (four reports) or early removals of the device (two reports). ### Search Strategy We searched both MEDLINE and EMBASE, handsearches of journals through CENTRAL, and lists of references. We also wrote to international experts in the field to identify unpublished studies. ### Selection Criteria We included randomized controlled trials using any antibiotic compared with a placebo. We found four such trials; two had pilot study data available. ### Data Extraction We used searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and handsearches of journals available through CENTRAL. We also reviewed lists of references in original research and in review articles. We wrote to experts to identify unpublished trials and made telephone calls to authors to supply missing information. Two independent reviewers abstracted data. We assessed the validity of each study using methods suggested in the Cochrane Handbook. ### Data Synthesis We generated 2x2 tables for the principal outcome measures. We used the Peto modified Mantel-Haenszel technique to calculate odds ratios and assessed statistical heterogeneity between studies. ### Main Results The odds ratios for pelvic inflammatory disease associated with use of prophylactic doxycycline or azithromycin compared with placebo or no treatment was 0.89 (95%CI 0.53-1.51). Use of prophylaxis was associated with a small reduction in unscheduled vists to the provider (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.70-0.98). Use of doxycycline or azithromycin had little effect on the likelihood of removal of the IUD within 90 days of insertion ( OR 1.05 ; 95 % CI 0.68 - 1.63 ) . Significant heterogeneity did not exist between studies. ### Reviewer S Conclusions Use of either doxycycline 200 mg or azithromycin 500 mg by mouth before IUD insertion confers little benefit. While the reduction in unscheduled visits to the provider was marginally significant, the cost-effectiveness of routine prophylaxis remains questionable. A uniform finding in these trials was the low risk of IUD-associated infection, with or without use of antibiotic prophylaxis.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10796777/"}

The increase in the mucosal expression of angiotensin II (AT-II) in colitis suggests a possible role of AT-II in colitis-associated inflammation. Here, we examined the potential therapeutic effects of combination therapy regarding valsartan (Val), as an AT-II receptor blocker, with sulfasalazine (SSZ) in a murine colitis model. DSS induced colitis was initiated by the administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in male C57BL/6 mice for 1 week. Val (160 mg/kg/day, gavage) was given on the third day and continued for seven days. SSZ (100 mg/kg/day) was used as reference drug and also used in combination in one group (Val; 160 mg/kg/day and/or SSZ; 100 mg/kg/day). Colonic mucosal inflammation was evaluated clinically, biochemically, and histologically. The disease activity index in DSS-treated mice, including weight loss, stool consistency, and rectal bleeding, were significantly lower in the group of mice receiving the combination of valsartan and sulfasalazine compared to the DSS-treated group. valsartan and sulfasalazine treatment was associated with a lower reduction in colon length, diminished colon weight, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein level in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Valsartan and sulfasalazine also reduced markers of oxidative stress after DSS administration .

The aims of the present study were to compare, in vitro and in vivo, the antiangiogenic and antitumor activities of metronomic irinotecan (CPT-11), oxaliplatin (L-OHP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in colorectal cancer and to investigate the metronomic combination of these drugs. In vitro cell proliferation, combination studies and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion analyses were performed on endothelial (HMVEC-d) and colorectal cancer (HT-29) cells exposed for 144 h to metronomic concentrations of SN-38, the active metabolite of CPT-11, L-OHP and 5-FU. HT-29 human colorectal cancer xenograft model was used and tumour growth, microvessel density and VEGF quantification were performed in tumours after the administration of metronomic CPT-11, L-OHP, 5-FU and their simultaneous combination. Low concentrations of SN-38, but not 5-FU and L-OHP, preferentially inhibited endothelial cell proliferation. Simultaneous and continuous exposure of HT-29 and HMVEC-d cells to low concentrations SN-38+L-OHP+5-FU for 144 h showed a strong antagonism and an unfavorable dose-reduction index.

The first trial was a multicenter randomized phase III study of chemotherapy ( doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel ) + /- trastuzumab , and the second was a multicenter phase II trial of vinorelbine + trastuzumab . All patients had measurable disease and were free of symptomatic CNS disease at initiation of study treatment. ### results Nearly 10% of patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy developed isolated CNS metastases as first site of tumor progression. Progression in the CNS tended to be a later event than progression at other sites among women receiving trastuzumab-based therapy. trastuzumab-based treatment did not substantially delay onset of CNS metastases as initial site of progression. Following diagnosis with primary breast cancer, tumors with HER2 gene amplification tend to be associated with greater risk of isolated CNS progression compared with those lacking gene amplification. ### conclusions Patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer are at risk for isolated CNS progression, reflecting improved peripheral tumor control and patient survival through use of trastuzumab-based therapy, and a relative lack of CNS activity with trastuzumab.

Members of the human epidermal receptor (HER) family are frequently associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in multiple malignancies. lapatinib is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-2. This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of lapatinib, alone and in combination with SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan (CPT-11), in colon and gastric cancer cell lines. Concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of both lapatinib and SN-38 were observed in all colon and gastric cancer cell lines tested but varied significantly between individual cell lines (lapatinib range 0.08-11.7 muM; SN-38 range 3.6-256 nM). lapatinib potently inhibited the growth of a HER-2 overexpressing gastric cancer cell line and demonstrated moderate activity in gastric and colon cancer cells with detectable HER-2 expression. The combination of lapatinib and SN-38 interacted synergistically to inhibit cell proliferation in all colon and gastric cancer cell lines tested. Cotreatment with lapatinib and SN-38 also resulted in enhanced cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis with subsequent cellular pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrating that lapatinib promoted the increased intracellular accumulation and retention of SN-38 when compared to SN-38 treatment alone. Finally, the combination of lapatinib and CPT-11 demonstrated synergistic antitumor efficacy in the LoVo colon cancer mouse xenograft model with no apparent increase in toxicity compared to CPT-11 monotherapy. These results provide compelling preclinical rationale indicating lapatinib to be a potentially efficacious chemotherapeutic combination partner for irinotecan in the treatment of gastrointestinal carcinomas .", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19536776/"}

In order to investigate the effects of a realistic pharmaceutical mixture on an ecosystem , a study utilizing 15 of 12,000 L aquatic microcosms treated with eight common pharmaceuticals ( atorvastatin , acetaminophen , caffeine , sulfamethoxazole , carbamazepine , levofloxacin , sertraline , and trimethoprim ) at total ( summed ) molar concentrations of 0 , 0.044 , 0.608 , 2.664 , and 24.538 micromol/L ( n = 3 ) was conducted . Phytotoxicity was assessed on a variety of somatic and pigment endpoints in rooted (Myriophyllum sibiricum) and floating (Lemna gibba) macrophytes over a 35-day period. EC10, EC25 and EC50 values were calculated for each endpoint exhibiting a concentration-dependent response. Generally, M. sibiricum and L. gibba displayed similar sensitivity to the pharmaceutical mixture, with phytotoxic injury evident in both species, which was concentration dependent. Through single compound 7-day daily static renewal toxicity tests with L. gibba, the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the fluoroquinolone antibiotic levofloxacin and the blood lipid regulator atorvastatin were found to be the only compounds to elicit phytotoxic effects in the concentration range utilized (0-1000 microg/L). atorvastatin concentration was highly correlated to decreased pigment content in L. gibba, likely inhibiting the known target enzyme HMGR, the rate-limiting enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Hazard quotients were calculated for both microcosm and laboratory studies; the highest HQ values were 0.235 (L. gibba) and 0.051 (L. gibba), which are below the threshold value of 1 for chronic risks. The microcosm data suggest that at an ecological effect size of >20%, biologically significant risks are low for L. gibba and M. sibiricum exposed to similar mixtures of pharmaceutical compounds.

H. pylori was eradicated in 63 patients (86%; 95% confidence interval: 76.6-93.2; intention-to-treat and per protocol). There were no serious adverse reactions and were no withdrawals due to any side-effects. All of side-effects were self-limiting (dark stools, urine discoloration, blackening of the tongue, and others). ### conclusions The combination of nifuratel, bismuth subcitrate, and amoxicillin was an effective and tolerable regimen for H. pylori eradication.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17309749/"}

They then received monophasic ethinyloestradiol plus either desogestrel or levonorgestrel for three cycles. After this, the women took sequential pills containing ethinyloestradiol plus either desogestrel or levonorgestrel for the three following cycles. Fasting blood samples were drawn pretreatment and at the end of each treatment. ### patients The study group consisted of 30 apparently healthy women, aged 18-35. They were randomly divided into desogestrel and levonorgestrel groups, each consisting of 15 women. ### measurements Cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipids were determined in whole serum and in all lipoprotein fractions (following isolation of lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation). Plasma apolipoprotein A-I concentration, post-heparin plasma lipase activities and serum sex hormone binding globulin were also measured. ### results desogestrel (150 micrograms/day) did not change serum total triglyceride concentration, whereas levonorgestrel (150 micrograms/day) decreased it. Except for monophasic ethinyloestradiol plus levonorgestrel, the oestrogen-containing combinations increased serum triglyceride level. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remained stable with all treatments, but the cholesterol/triglyceride ratio of LDL decreased during all combinations with ethinyloestradiol. levonorgestrel reduced total high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and both progestins reduced HDL2 cholesterol concentration. Addition of ethinyloestradiol reversed this change in the desogestrel but not in the levonorgestrel group. The polyphasic ethinyloestradiol plus levonorgestrel combination did not change total HDL cholesterol. Hepatic lipase was activated with either progestin when administered alone but its activity was suppressed below the baseline level when ethinyloestradiol was added. Conversely, both progestins suppressed sex hormone binding globulin levels, but addition of ethinyloestradiol caused marked increases above baseline. These increases were greater in women taking desogestrel than in those taking levonorgestrel. No treatment affected lipoprotein lipase activity significantly. ### conclusions Monophasic or polyphasic combinations of ethinyloestradiol and desogestrel do not have deleterious effects on serum lipoproteins. If levonorgestrel is used as the progestin component, polyphasic ethinyloestradiol plus levonorgestrel appears more favourable than monophasic ethinyloestradiol plus levonorgestrel.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1533186/"}

Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a common clinical problem that is often associated with evaporative dry eye disease. Alterations of the lipids of the meibomian glands have been identified in several studies of MGD. This prospective, observational, open-label clinical trial documents the improvement in both clinical signs and symptoms of disease as well as spectroscopic characteristics of the meibomian gland lipids after therapy with topical azithromycin ophthalmic solution and oral doxycycline treatment. ### methods Subjects with symptomatic MGD were recruited. Signs of MGD were evaluated with a slit lamp. Symptoms of MGD were measured by the response of subjects to a questionnaire. Meibum lipid-lipid interaction strength, conformation, and phase transition parameters, and meibum protein content were measured using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and principal component analysis. Terpenoids, short-chain CH3 moieties, lipid oxidation, wax, cholesterylesters and glycerides were measured with a proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) spectrometer. ### results Topical therapy with azithromycin and oral therapy with doxycycline relieved signs and symptoms and restored the lipid properties of the meibomian gland secretion toward normal . Compared with 4 weeks of azithromycin treatment reported in our previous study, oral doxycycline treatment was slightly less effective in improving foreign body sensation and the signs of plugging and secretion. In subjects with clinical evidence of MGD, changes in ordering of the lipids and phase transition temperature were brought closer to normal with azithromycin treatment than doxycycline treatment. Treatment with doxycycline but not azithromycin restored the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-principal component analysis scores and relative area of the H-NMR resonance at 1.26 ppm. Both doxycycline and azithromycin treatment restored the levels of the relative areas of the H-NMR resonance at 5.2 and 7.9 ppm to normal levels. The levels of meibum protein and meibum lipid oxidation were not influenced by azithromycin or doxycycline treatment. ### conclusions The mechanism of action of doxycycline may be different from that of azithromycin in therapy of MGD. It is notable that when carotenoids in meibum are low, as in MGD, the tear film is unstable and patients have the signs and symptoms of dry eyes. When carotenoids are restored with azithromycin and doxycycline treatment, tear film stability is restored and patients no longer have the signs and symptoms of dry eyes.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22668581/"}

Glioma is the most common highly aggressive, primary adult brain tumour. Clinical data show that therapeutic approaches cannot reach the expectations in patients, thus gliomas are mainly incurable diseases. Tumour cells can adapt rapidly to alterations during therapeutic treatments related to their metabolic rewiring and profound heterogeneity in tissue environment. Renewed interests aim to develop effective treatments targeting angiogenesis, kinase activity and/or cellular metabolism. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), whose hyper-activation is characteristic for many tumours, promotes metabolic alterations, macromolecule biosynthesis, cellular growth and survival. Unfortunately, mTOR inhibitors with their lower toxicity have not resulted in appreciable survival benefit. Analysing mTOR inhibitor sensitivity, other metabolism targeting treatments and their combinations could help to find potential agents and biomarkers for therapeutic development in glioma patients. ### methods In vitro proliferation assays, protein expression and metabolite concentration analyses were used to study the effects of mTOR inhibitors, other metabolic treatments and their combinations in glioma cell lines. Furthermore, mTOR activity and cellular metabolism related protein expression patterns were also investigated by immunohistochemistry in human biopsies. temozolomide and/or rapamycin treatments altered the expressions of enzymes related to lipid synthesis, glycolysis and mitochondrial functions as consequences of metabolic adaptation; therefore, other anti-metabolic drugs (chloroquine, etomoxir, doxycycline) were combined in vitro. ### results Our results suggest that co-targeting metabolic pathways had tumour cell dependent additive/synergistic effects related to mTOR and metabolic protein expression patterns cell line dependently. Drug combinations , especially rapamycin + doxycycline may have promising anti-tumour effect in gliomas . Additionally, our immunohistochemistry results suggest that metabolic and mTOR activity alterations are not related to the recent glioma classification, and these protein expression profiles show individual differences in patients' materials. ### conclusions Based on these, combinations of different new/old drugs targeting cellular metabolism could be promising to inhibit high adaptation capacity of tumour cells depending on their metabolic shifts.

Patients were stratified by tumor origin in the left vs right sides. ### interventions Treatment with SC or SC plus bevacizumab or cetuximab. ### Main Outcomes And Measures Mortality hazards by tumor origin (right vs left sides) were assessed for patients receiving SC alone or SC plus bevacizumab or cetuximab. Subgroup analysis for patients with wild-type KRAS tumors was also performed. ### results A total of 11\u202f905 patients with mCRC (6713 men [56.4%] and 5192 women [43.6%]; mean [SD] age, 60.0 [10.9] years) were eligible for the study. Among these, 4632 patients received SC and BT. Compared with SC alone, SC plus bevacizumab reduced mortality among patients with right- and left-sided mCRC, whereas SC plus cetuximab reduced mortality only among patients with left-sided tumors and was associated with significantly higher mortality for right-sided tumors (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14-1.51; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among patients treated with SC plus BT, right-sided tumor origin was associated with higher mortality among patients receiving bevacizumab (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.25-1.36; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and cetuximab (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.68-2.12; P\u2009<\u2009.001) BT, compared with left-sided tumor origin. In patients with wild-type KRAS tumors (n\u2009=\u2009668), cetuximab was associated with reduced mortality among only patients with left-sided mCRC compared with bevacizumab (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.90; P\u2009=\u2009.002), whereas patients with right-sided mCRC had more than double the mortality compared with those with left-sided mCRC (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.83-3.25, P\u2009<\u2009.001). ### Conclusions And Relevance Primary tumor site is associated with response to BT in mCRC. Right-sided primary tumor location is associated with higher mortality regardless of BT type. In patients with wild-type KRAS tumors, treatment with cetuximab benefited only those with left-sided mCRC and was associated with significantly poorer survival among those with right-sided mCRC.

There was no association between EGFR protein expression and sensitivity to any of the HER-targeted agents. Cell cycle analysis revealed that lapatinib induced G(1) arrest in sensitive lines and phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated ERK were decreased in response to lapatinib as well. The combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab was highly synergistic in inhibiting cell growth with a combination index of <1.

ATAC, a randomized, double-blind trial, compared tamoxifen (20 mg) with anastrozole ('Arimidex') (1 mg) alone, and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen (combination), as adjuvant endocrine treatment for postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer. Patients with operable invasive breast cancer following completion of primary therapy, who were candidates to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy, were eligible for this study. Primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and tolerability. Other endpoints included time to recurrence (TTR: censoring non-breast cancer deaths before recurrence) and the incidence of contralateral breast cancer. A total of 9366 patients were included in this study (N=3125, 3116 and 3125 for anastrozole, tamoxifen and the combination, respectively). Median duration of therapy was 30.7 months and median follow-up was 33.3 months. The total numbers of events were 317, 379 and 383 for anastrozole, tamoxifen and the combination, respectively. DFS was significantly improved in the overall population for anastrozole versus tamoxifen (hazard ratio (HR)=0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.71-0.96), P=0.013). anastrozole showed improved TTR compared with tamoxifen (HR=0.79, CI (0.67-0.94), P=0.008), which improved even further in the ER+ and/or PR+ subgroup (HR=0.73, CI (0.59-0.90), P=0.003). The incidences of hot flushes, thromboembolic events, ischaemic cerebrovascular events, vaginal bleeding/discharge and endometrial cancer were significantly reduced with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen (P<0.03 for all). Musculoskeletal disorders and fractures were significantly reduced in patients receiving tamoxifen compared with those on anastrozole (P<0.03 for both). No increase in hip fractures was seen for anastrozole versus tamoxifen (11 versus 13, respectively). Combination treatment was equivalent to tamoxifen in terms of both efficacy and tolerability. anastrozole showed superior efficacy to tamoxifen for DFS, TTR and contralateral breast cancer. Early findings show anastrozole to be an effective and well-tolerated endocrine option for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer. For the first time a choice now exists for adjuvant endocrine treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone responsive tumours. Longer follow-up will further define the benefit/risk of anastrozole adjuvant therapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14623537/"}

The most commonly used regimen for the treatment of advanced Hodgkin's disease (HD) is ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine). Two of these components, bleomycin and dacarbazine, have defined toxicities such as pulmonary fibrosis and nausea/vomiting, and also uncertain single-drug activity. The EVA regimen ( etoposide , vinblastine , doxorubicin ) is an attempt to substitute a known active agent , etoposide , for bleomycin and dacarbazine . ### Patients And Methods A series of 51 patients with advanced HD without prior systemic therapy were treated. The series included 12 stage II patients with bulky (>10 cm) mediastinal tumors, 10 of whom received complementary radiation therapy. The remaining patients received EVA only. Response, duration of response, survival, toxicity and the efficacy of salvage therapy were evaluated in all patients. The median follow-up time was 111 months and permitted an assessment of the long-term effects of treatment and natural history of a cohort of treated patients. ### results EVA achieved a complete response (or clinical complete response) in 48/51 patients (94%). Of these 48 responders, 16 relapsed in a median of 11 months (range 3-48 months). In follow-up, 32/51 patients had no evidence of relapsed HD, although three died from other causes (two from vascular events and one from large cell lymphoma), resulting in progression-free survival for the entire group of 57% at 111 months.

In this review, we will consider the mechanisms of chemoresistance of the five groups of cytotoxic drugs commonly used in the treatment of advanced NSCLC as well as the clinical studies which have assessed the value of chemoresistance markers. Breast Cancer Related Protein (BRCP) expression has been related to irinotecan and cisplatin (CDDP) resistance. DNA repair capacity influences response to CDDP and ERCC1 gene stands out as a predictive marker of CDDP sensitivity. Preliminary studies indicate that high tubulin III and stathmin mRNA levels correlate with response to paclitaxel and vinorelbine and that high expression of class III tubulin by tumor cells assessed immunohistochemically in patients receiving a taxane-based regimen is associated with a poor response to chemotherapy, and a shorter progression-free survival. High expression levels of ribonucleotide reductase has also been related to response to gemcitabine. Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1 (UGT1A1) genotype has been reported to be associated with time to progression and survival in patients treated with irinotecan.

We treated C6 glioma cells with carvedilol alone and a combination of carvedilol and imatinib mesylate at a concentration of 10 microM.

There are no data that describe the activity of panitumumab in patients with progressive disease on cetuximab. We performed a single-arm phase II trial of panitumumab in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer that had progressed on prior cetuximab . ### Patients And Methods We used a two-stage study design to treat patients with panitumumab at 6 mg/kg every 14 days (cycle length = 28 days). Treatment was continued until disease progression, death, inability to tolerate panitumumab, or study withdrawal. The primary endpoint was response rate; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and overall survival. Twenty patients were treated in the first stage, with plans to treat an additional twelve patients if there was at least one objective response. We collected blood samples at baseline and prior to cycles 2 and 3 to evaluate for the presence of anti-cetuximab and anti-panitumumab antibodies. ### results We treated twenty patients for a median of two cycles (range 1-4). No patients responded, and 45% had a best response of stable disease (no progression for at least two cycles). Median progression-free survival was 1.7 months and median overall survival was 5.2 months. panitumumab was well tolerated. Thirteen patients (65%) had grade 1-2 dry skin or rash, and three patients had treatment-related grade 3 toxicities (one each with hyperglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypokalemia). No patients had detectable anti-cetuximab antibodies at any time point; one patient developed anti-panitumumab antibodies. ### conclusions panitumumab has minimal benefit in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed on prior cetuximab. Discussion Both cetuximab and panitumumab competitively inhibit ligand binding to EGFR, thereby promoting receptor internalization and blocking receptor-mediated signaling. Although the two agents have never been compared directly in a randomized clinical trial, they produce similar response rates when used alone as well as in combination with cytotoxic agents. cetuximab is a chimeric antibody with approximately 30% murine protein, while panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody. Correspondingly, rates of severe hypersensitivity reactions are somewhat increased with cetuximab (3%) compared to panitumumab (1%). However, the potential efficacy of panitumumab in patients who have developed disease progression on cetuximab has been an open question. Metges et al. (PANERB trial) prospectively treated 32 KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patients with cetuximab and irinotecan followed by panitumumab monotherapy after progression. Remarkably, the authors reported an objective response rate of 22% to panitumumab, including a disease control rate (objective response plus stable disease) of 73% in 11 patients who had previously responded to cetuximab and irinotecan. In contrast, we found no responders and a stable disease rate of 45% with a median duration of only 1.7 months in our trial of 20 patients. Moreover, no patients had detectable anti-cetuximab antibodies at baseline. It is not clear to what extent the PANERB trial included patients without objective disease progression on cetuximab or for whom cetuximab-containing regimens may have been ceased due to toxicity in the absence of disease progression. In both circumstances, retreatment with panitumumab may be expected to demonstrate some degree of clinical activity. In our study, disease progression after at least 4 weeks of cetuximab documented radiographically or by increased carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels was required for inclusion in order to ensure that the study population demonstrated unequivocal evidence of progression on cetuximab. While it remains possible that a small subset of patients may benefit from panitumumab after progression on cetuximab, our results suggest that this approach should not be adopted until predictive biomarkers for panitumumab response in this setting have been discovered and validated. Until then, patients who develop progression on cetuximab should be enrolled in trials of novel agents.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22210091/"}

Data from untreated (U) rats were compared with data from rats treated with single-agent therapy (C-, M- and F-treatment groups), with data from double-agent therapy (CM-, MF- and CF-treatment groups) and with data from the triple combination: the CMF-treatment group. Doses of agents of interest were the same in all treatment groups. The sequence of administration was (1) CY; (2) MTX and (3) FUra which is similar to clinical treatment with CMF. Systemic levels of CY, MTX and FUra were comparable to those found in patients treated according to the CMF regimen. Toxicity was evaluated by body-weight changes, water and food consumption, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet cell (Pts) counts. With the exception of WBC and Pts nadirs, estimated toxicity parameters reflected toxicity over the whole treatment period of 14 days. The toxicity was generally mild and well tolerated, with one fatality in the M-treatment group. CY was the main contributor to toxicity; it caused both myelotoxicity and gastro-intestinal toxicity. The contribution of FUra was judged to be negligible. MTX + FUra did not increase host toxicity in a synergistic or even an additional fashion. The absence of addition or synergism of toxic side-effects can be explained both by site-specific interactions at the pharmacodynamic level and by interactions at the pharmacokinetic level.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2019458/"}

Orofacial pain was induced by subcutaneous (sc) injection of formalin (50 \u03bcl, 1%) in the upper lip region and the time spent face rubbing was recorded in 3 min blocks for 45 min.

Histamine increased morphine-induced antinociception. pyrilamine and ranitidine had no effects when used alone, whereas pretreatments with pyrilamine and ranitidine prevented histamine- and morphine-induced antinociceptive effects. naloxone alone non-significantly increased pain intensity and inhibited the antinociceptive effects of morphine and histamine. The results of the present study indicate that at the level of the hippocampus, histamine through its H(1) and H(2) receptors, mediates orofacial region pain.

Insensitivity towards anthracycline drugs like doxorubicin poses a significant challenge in the treatment of breast cancer. Among several factors, Aurora A (a mitotic serine threonine kinase) plays crucial roles in acquiring non-responsiveness towards doxorubicin. However, the mechanisms underlying need to be elucidated. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of Aurora A mediated doxorubicin insensitivity in MCF-7Dox/R, an isolated resistant-subline of MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma cell line). Effect of curcumin , a natural phytochemical in restoring doxorubicin sensitivity by targeting Aurora A was assessed furthermore . ### methods A doxorubicin resistant subline (MCF-7Dox/R) was isolated from the parental MCF-7 cells by treating the cell with gradual step-wise increasing concentration of the drug. Expressions of Aurora A and its target proteins (Akt, I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF\u03baB) were assessed in both parental and MCF-7Dox/R cells. Both the cell lines were pretreated with curcumin prior to doxorubicin treatment. Cellular proliferation rate was measured using BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) assay kit. Intracellular doxorubicin accumulation was estimated spectrofluorimetrically. Cellular uptake of curcumin (spectrophotometric and spectrofluorimetric method) and its nuclear localization was confirmed by confocal microscopic study. Protein expressions were determined by western blot analysis. Localization of Aurora A was ascertained by immunofluorescence assay. To explore the possible outcome of impact of curcumin on Aurora A, cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis were performed subsequently. ### results Higher expressions of Aurora A in MCF-7Dox/R cells led to phosphorylation of Akt as well as I\u03baB\u03b1.

Topical analgesic drugs are used for a variety of painful conditions. Some are acute, typically strains or sprains, tendinopathy, or muscle aches.

The primary outcome was at least 50% pain relief (participant-reported) at an appropriate duration. We extracted the number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNT) for efficacy outcomes for each topical analgesic or formulation, and the number needed to treat for one additional harmful outcome (NNH) for adverse events. We also extracted information on withdrawals due to lack of efficacy or adverse events, systemic and local adverse events, and serious adverse events. We required information from at least 200 participants, in at least two studies. We judged that there was potential for publication bias if the addition of four studies of typical size (400 participants) with zero effect increased NNT compared with placebo to 10 (minimal clinical utility). We extracted GRADE assessment in the original papers, and made our own GRADE assessment. ### Main Results Thirteen Cochrane Reviews (206 studies with around 30,700 participants) assessed the efficacy and harms from a range of topical analgesics applied to intact skin in a number of acute and chronic painful conditions. Reviews were overseen by several Review Groups, and concentrated on evidence comparing topical analgesic with topical placebo; comparisons of topical and oral analgesics were rare.For at least 50% pain relief, we considered evidence was moderate or high quality for several therapies, based on the underlying quality of studies and susceptibility to publication bias.In acute musculoskeletal pain (strains and sprains) with assessment at about seven days, therapies were diclofenac Emulgel (78% Emulgel, 20% placebo; 2 studies, 314 participants, NNT 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.1)), ketoprofen gel (72% ketoprofen, 33% placebo, 5 studies, 348 participants, NNT 2.5 (2.0 to 3.4)), piroxicam gel (70% piroxicam, 47% placebo, 3 studies, 522 participants, NNT 4.4 (3.2 to 6.9)), diclofenac Flector plaster (63% Flector, 41% placebo, 4 studies, 1030 participants, NNT 4.7 (3.7 to 6.5)), and diclofenac other plaster (88% diclofenac plaster, 57% placebo, 3 studies, 474 participants, NNT 3.2 (2.6 to 4.2)).In chronic musculoskeletal pain (mainly hand and knee osteoarthritis) therapies were topical diclofenac preparations for less than six weeks (43% diclofenac, 23% placebo, 5 studies, 732 participants, NNT 5.0 (3.7 to 7.4)), ketoprofen over 6 to 12 weeks (63% ketoprofen, 48% placebo, 4 studies, 2573 participants, NNT 6.9 (5.4 to 9.3)), and topical diclofenac preparations over 6 to 12 weeks (60% diclofenac, 50% placebo, 4 studies, 2343 participants, NNT 9.8 (7.1 to 16)). In postherpetic neuralgia, topical high-concentration capsaicin had moderate-quality evidence of limited efficacy (33% capsaicin, 24% placebo, 2 studies, 571 participants, NNT 11 (6.1 to 62)).We judged evidence of efficacy for other therapies as low or very low quality. Limited evidence of efficacy, potentially subject to publication bias, existed for topical preparations of ibuprofen gels and creams, unspecified diclofenac formulations and diclofenac gel other than Emulgel, indomethacin, and ketoprofen plaster in acute pain conditions, and for salicylate rubefacients for chronic pain conditions. Evidence for other interventions (other topical NSAIDs, topical salicylate in acute pain conditions, low concentration capsaicin, lidocaine, clonidine for neuropathic pain, and herbal remedies for any condition) was very low quality and typically limited to single studies or comparisons with sparse data.We assessed the evidence on withdrawals as moderate or very low quality, because of small numbers of events. In chronic pain conditions lack of efficacy withdrawals were lower with topical diclofenac (6%) than placebo (9%) (11 studies, 3455 participants, number needed to treat to prevent (NNTp) 26, moderate-quality evidence), and topical salicylate (2% vs 7% for placebo) (5 studies, 501 participants, NNTp 21, very low-quality evidence). Adverse event withdrawals were higher with topical capsaicin low-concentration (15%) than placebo (3%) (4 studies, 477 participants, NNH 8, very low-quality evidence), topical salicylate (5% vs 1% for placebo) (7 studies, 735 participants, NNH 26, very low-quality evidence), and topical diclofenac (5% vs 4% for placebo) (12 studies, 3552 participants, NNH 51, very low-quality evidence).In acute pain, systemic or local adverse event rates with topical NSAIDs (4.3%) were no greater than with topical placebo (4.6%) (42 studies, 6740 participants, high quality evidence). In chronic pain local adverse events with topical capsaicin low concentration (63%) were higher than topical placebo (5 studies, 557 participants, number needed to treat for harm (NNH) 2.6), high quality evidence. Moderate-quality evidence indicated more local adverse events than placebo in chronic pain conditions with topical diclofenac (NNH 16) and local pain with topical capsaicin high-concentration (NNH 16). There was moderate-quality evidence of no additional local adverse events with topical ketoprofen over topical placebo in chronic pain. Serious adverse events were rare (very low-quality evidence).GRADE assessments of moderate or low quality in some of the reviews were considered by us to be very low because of small numbers of participants and events. ### Authors Conclusions There is good evidence that some formulations of topical diclofenac and ketoprofen are useful in acute pain conditions such as sprains or strains, with low (good) NNT values. There is a strong message that the exact formulation used is critically important in acute conditions, and that might also apply to other pain conditions. In chronic musculoskeletal conditions with assessments over 6 to 12 weeks , topical diclofenac and ketoprofen had limited efficacy in hand and knee osteoarthritis , as did topical high-concentration capsaicin in postherpetic neuralgia . Though NNTs were higher, this still indicates that a small proportion of people had good pain relief.Use of GRADE in Cochrane Reviews with small numbers of participants and events requires attention.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28497473/"}

Methods A phase I, modified 3\u2009+\u20093 Fibonacci schema determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus, followed by phase II dose expansion. The phase II primary objective was progression-free survival at 6\u00a0months (PFS-6\u00a0m). Results The everolimus MTD was 10\u00a0mg daily with mFOLFOX6\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab based on safety from phase I (n\u2009=\u200922).

The weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin regimen was designed to optimize the radiosensitizing properties of paclitaxel during the concurrent phase of treatment. ### Methods And Materials Forty-three patients with unresectable stage IIIA and IIIB NSCLC from the Vanderbilt Cancer Center and Affiliate Network (VCCAN) institutions were entered onto the study from June 1996 until May 1997. Weekly intravenous (IV) paclitaxel (50 mg/m(2)/l-hour) and weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) plus concurrent hyperfractionated chest RT (1.2 Gy/BID/69.6 Gy) were delivered for 6 weeks followed by 2 cycles of paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC 6). ### results Forty-two patients were evaluable for response and toxicities. Three patients achieved a complete response (7.2%) and 30 patients achieved a partial response (71.4%), for an overall response rate of 78.6% [95% C.I. (66.2%-91.0%)].

Gastrointestinal ALK+ ALCL is rare. Multiple lymphomatous polyposis (MLP) is thought to be a representative form of gastrointestinal lesion in mantle cell lymphoma, and T-cell lymphomas seldom show this feature.

ALK+ ALCL was diagnosed pathologically. Computed tomography scan demonstrated multiple lymph node lesions in the abdomen - pelvis/inguinal region, and scattered nodular lesions in both lung fields. He did not complain of gastrointestinal symptoms. While, esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified MLP lesions from the antrum of the stomach to the descending portion of the duodenum and mild thickened folds on the corpus of the stomach, and biopsy showed invasion of ALK+ ALCL. We treated this patient with six cycles of CHOEP ( Cyclophosphamide , Doxorubicin , Vincristine , Etoposide , and Prednisone ) chemotherapy . At the conclusion of treatment, there was complete remission. Numerous white scars were found on the stomach, endoscopically consistent with a remission image of lymphoma.

Okadaic acid as well as other, structurally different, inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A induce apoptosis in pituitary GH3 cells. Incubation with stepwise raised concentrations of okadaic acid resulted in the isolation of cells that were increasingly less sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of this agent. After about 18 months cells were selected that survived at 300 nM okadaic acid, which is about 30 times the initially lethal concentration. This study revealed that a major pharmacokinetic mechanism underlying cell survival was the development of a P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. The increase in mRNA levels of the mdr1b P-glycoprotein isoform correlated with the extent of drug resistance. Functional assays revealed that increasing drug resistance was paralleled by a decreased accumulation of rhodamine 123, a fluorescent dye which is a substrate of mdr1-mediated efflux activity. Resistance could be abolished by structurally different chemosensitizers of P-glycoprotein function like verapamil and reserpine but not by the leukotriene receptor antagonist MK571 which is a modulator of the multidrug resistance-associated protein ( MRP ) .

Thus, functional as well as biochemical features support the conclusion that okadaic acid is a substrate of the mdr1-mediated efflux activity in rat pituitary GH3 cells. Maintenance of resistance after withdrawal of okadaic acid as well as metaphase spreads of 100 nM okadaic acid-resistant cells suggested a stable MDR genotype without indications for the occurrence of extrachromosomal amplifications, e.g. double minute chromosomes.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10494879/"}

A model was developed to simulate clinical events over time, based on a discrete Markov process with 6 mutually exclusive health states and annual cycle length. ### results The estimated lifetime budget cost for the cohort of 374 110 men aged 50 to 59 in Canada is between $6.35 billion and $7.60 billion, equivalent to between $16 979 and $20 315 per patient with moderate/severe symptoms associated with BPH. Costs are lower for FDC treatment, with the net difference in lifetime budget impact between the 2 treatment regimens at $1.25 billion. In this analysis, the true costs of BPH in Canada are underestimated for 2 main reasons: (1) to make the analysis tractable, it is restricted to a cohort aged 50 to 59, whereas BPH can affect all men; and (2) a closed cohort approach does not include the costs of new (incident) cases. ### conclusion Canadian clinical guidelines recommend the use of the combination of tamsulosin and dutasteride for men with moderate/severe symptoms associated with BPH and enlarged prostate volume . This analysis, using a representational patient group, suggests that the FDC is a more cost-effective treatment option for BPH.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24454593/"}

In a separate set of experiments, the effects of the drugs combined (1 mg/kg per day) was compared with those induced by each drug alone. ### results The drug combination dose-dependently decreased systolic blood pressure and its hypotensive effect was more marked than those induced by each treatment administered alone (untreated 208 +/- 5 mmHg, indapamide 185 +/- 5 mmHg, perindopril 150 +/- 3 and the combination 123 +/- 7 mmHg). A 12-week treatment with the drug combination (1 mg/kg per day) was not accompanied by any change in diuresis or urinary excretion of Na or K. The same treatment decreased cardiac hypertrophy and collagen. At the vascular level, the drug combination decreased aortic, carotid and femoral media cross-sectional areas, as well as aortic and carotid collagen density. This latter effect was accompanied by a significant increase in carotid artery compliance assessed in vivo at constant pressure. Finally, in isolated aortae, chronic combined drug treatment was associated with an increased basal release of nitric oxide and a decrease in the hypertension-induced endothelium-dependent contractions in response to acetylcholine. ### conclusion These experiments suggest that chronic combined treatment with low doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic such as indapamide may be of value in the treatment of hypertension.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8986928/"}

A randomized phase 2 study was performed to investigate the efficacy/toxicity of combining concomitant boost radiation and weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without amifostine in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). ### methods Patients with newly diagnosed , locally advanced stage III or IV SCCHN received 4 weekly doses of carboplatin ( area under the curve , 1.5 ) and paclitaxel ( 45 mg/m(2 ) ) concurrently with concomitant boost radiation consisting of 72 grays in 42 fractions over 6 weeks ( every day for 18 days , twice a day for 12 days ) ( grading determined according to the TNM staging system ) . All patients were randomized to subcutaneous daily amifostine at a dose of 500 mg (Arm A) or no amifostine (Arm B). Toxicity data were collected weekly, and saliva collection was performed with and without citric acid stimulation. To evaluate the correlation between serum cytokine levels and the severity of oral mucositis, we evaluated a subset (13 patients in Arm A and 11 patients in Arm B) of subjects at baseline and then on alternate weeks. ### results Fifty-eight patients were enrolled, 29 in each arm. The majority of patients were men (90%), had stage IV disease (82%), and had the oropharynx as the primary tumor site (60%). Major toxicities encountered were similar in both arms and included grade 3 (as determined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0) mucositis (75% in Arm A and 70% in Arm B) and grade 2 xerostomia (41% in both arms). The median number of amifostine doses delivered was 28, with skin toxicity (grade 3 in 11 patients) as the limiting factor. Saliva production showed no difference between the arms. The median follow-up was 34 months, and only 5 failures had been encountered (2 local and 3 distant) at the time of last follow-up, with an overall survival rate of 89%. Neck dissection was performed in 25 patients; 5 patients demonstrated persistent disease and 4 patients were alive without disease recurrence at the time of last follow-up. The median time to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy removal was 9.6 months in Arm A and 10.4 months in Arm B. Only 1 patient remained percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-dependent at the time of last follow-up. A correlation was noted between levels of selected cytokines and mucositis severity, in which higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin [IL]-1, and IL-6) and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-13) were noted. No changes in C-reactive protein levels were noted. ### conclusions Four weekly doses of carboplatin/paclitaxel with concomitant boost radiation was found to be a highly effective regimen in this patient population with advanced SCCHN. The overall survival rate was 89%. The time to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy removal was prolonged. amifostine given subcutaneously did not improve the rates of xerostomia and mucositis with this fairly intensive chemoradiotherapy regimen.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19634161/"}

Nevertheless, promising results indicate that certain combinations of antifungals may enhance prognosis of refractory fungal infections with a so far very serious prognosis.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14689198/"}

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of response to continuous-infusion ifosfamide and doxorubicin combination as second-line chemotherapy for patients with recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma. ### Materials And Methods Eighteen recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma patients who were treated with continuous-infusion ifosfamide and doxorubicin combination between May 1999 and April 2011 were included in the analysis. Ifosfamide at 12 g/m2 was administered by intravenous continuous infusion over 3 days , and doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 was administered as an intravenous bolus injection on day 1 . The combination therapy was repeated every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ### results The patients (ages 7-53 years) received a total of 42 cycles of chemotherapy (median: 2 courses; range: 2-5 courses). The overall response rate was 0% and the disease control rate was 22.3%, with four patients having stable disease. The median time to progression and overall survival time were 2 months (range: 2-5 months) and 9 months (range: 3-29 months), respectively. Major severe toxicities were leucopenia 7 (38.9%), nausea and vomiting 3 (16.7%) and alopecia 9 (50%). There were no treatment-related deaths. ### conclusions In our experience, continuous-infusion ifosfamide and doxorubicin combination therapy at this dosage and schedule was found to be well tolerated and moderate effective, which could be considered as salvage therapy for patients with recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma. Further assessment is necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of this treatment.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25824770/"}

The majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are driven by oncogenic KIT signaling and can therefore be effectively treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate. However, most GISTs develop imatinib resistance through secondary KIT mutations. The type of resistance mutation determines sensitivity to approved second-/third-line TKIs but shows high inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that target KIT independently of the mutational status are intriguing. Inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery with bortezomib is effective in GIST cells through a dual mechanism of KIT transcriptional downregulation and upregulation of the pro-apoptotic histone H2AX but clinically problematic due to the drug's adverse effects.

The anthracycline epirubicin has been investigated for intravesical use in patients with superficial bladder cancer. In multicentre, randomised trials, prophylaxis with intravesical epirubicin 30 to 80 mg after transurethral resection (TUR) was more effective than no prophylaxis in the prevention of disease recurrence. Intravesical prophylaxis with epirubicin was as effective as that with equivalent dosages of doxorubicin after TUR. Data are conflicting concerning the relative efficacy of intravesical epirubicin and bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in patients at intermediate risk of recurrence after TUR, but epirubicin was less effective than BCG in those at high risk. The efficacy and tolerability of prophylaxis with epirubicin relative to that with mitomycin is not yet established. The efficacy of epirubicin as prophylaxis after TUR in combination with BCG or interferon-alpha-2b, or as treatment in patients with superficial bladder cancer has been evaluated in small, noncomparative trials, but requires clarification. Adverse events associated with intravesical epirubicin were generally mild and transient. The most common adverse events were localised to the bladder (cystitis, haematuria and urinary tract infection). Systemic adverse events (cardiac, haematological or related to hypersensitivity) were not reported in many trials of intravesical epirubicin, and when reported generally occurred in < or =5% of patients who received the drug. Intravesical epirubicin was generally tolerated as well as intravesical doxorubicin and was associated with a lower incidence of mild chemical cystitis in 1 clinical trial . The incidence of adverse events associated with intravesical epirubicin was markedly lower than that associated with intravesical BCG. ### conclusions Intravesical epirubicin has shown efficacy in preventing disease recurrence after TUR of superficial bladder cancer. In comparison with equivalent dosages of doxorubicin, the efficacy of epirubicin for this indication is generally similar, and the tolerability profile may be more favourable. epirubicin is less effective than BCG as intravesical prophylaxis in patients at high risk of recurrence after TUR; the relative efficacy of epirubicin and BCG after TUR in patients at intermediate risk is not yet clear. Intravesical epirubicin is generally tolerated better than BCG. Intravesical epirubicin may be used as prophylaxis after TUR in patients who are at low or intermediate risk of recurrence of superficial bladder cancer.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10582777/"}

Serial drug concentrations and drug effects, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were monitored after administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone and in combination. The data were fitted to a PK/PD model and the parameters for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone and in combination were compared. ### results The plasma profiles for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide followed the two-compartment model after a single dose. The PK parameters of irbesartan were not affected by hydrochlorothiazide; however irbesartan decreased the hydrochlorothiazide AUC by 25% and increased its clearance by 25%. There were no significant changes in heart rate after each drug alone or in combination. irbesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide had a greater blood pressure lowering effect compared with irbesartan alone, despite the unchanged irbesartan PK. The relationship between irbesartan plasma concentration and its effects plotted in chronological order showed anticlockwise hysteresis. The PD parameter estimates for the effect of irbesartan on systolic blood pressure, when administered with hydrochlorothiazide were significantly different from those when irbesartan was administered alone. This was manifested by a 25% increase in Emax , and a 40% decrease in EC50 , suggesting a synergistic blood pressure lowering effect for the combination. While parameter estimates for the effect of irbesartan on diastolic blood pressure were changed by hydrochlorothiazide, the differences were only significant for EC50 . ### conclusion A limited potential for clinically significant interactions between irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide at the given doses were observed; therefore, no dosage adjustments were recommended for either drug when used together.

Current treatment target toward advanced colorectal cancers is mainly focused on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, but its additive effects with chemotherapy are still limited. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) cleaves the proheparin-binding epidermal growth factor like growth factor (proHB-EGF). And soluble HB-EGF activates EGFR. In parallel, the carboxy-terminal fragment of proHB-EGF (HB-EGF-CTF) translocates into the inner nuclear membrane, and subsequently exerts on the regulation of cell proliferation by binding nuclear promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, a transcriptional repressor, thereby causing its nuclear export.

The antibiotics were tested in an in vitro assay system in which infected mouse fibroblast cells (L929) were incubated for 3 days in various concentrations of the drugs.

Initial tests were conducted at the concentration of each antibiotic considered to be the upper breakpoint for susceptibility (16 micrograms/ml for doxycycline and 8 micrograms/ml for azithromycin). Growth of both Karp and AFSC-4 was strongly inhibited with both antibiotics, as measured by visual counts, although the percentage of cells infected with AFSC-4 in the presence of doxycycline was three times greater than the percentage of cells infected with Karp but was only 60% as great as the percentage of cells infected with Karp in the presence of azithromycin. Flow cytometry confirmed that rickettsial growth occurred in the absence of antibiotics, but it failed to detect it in the presence of high concentrations of either drug. Visual counts of rickettsial growth at lower concentrations of the antibiotics (0.25 to 0.0078 microgram/ml) showed that the Karp strain was 16 times more susceptible that the AFSC-4 strain to doxycycline. azithromycin was much more effective than doxycycline against AFSC-4, inhibiting rickettsial growth at 0.0156 microgram/ml to levels below that achieved by 0.25 microgram of doxycycline per ml. azithromycin was also more effective than doxycycline against the Karp strain, causing greater reductions in the number of rickettsiae per cell at lower concentrations.

In 2019, the Global Initiative for Asthma treatment guidelines were updated to recommend that inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) combination therapy should be a first-in-line treatment option for asthma. Although clinically superior to ICS, mechanisms underlying the efficacy of this combination therapy remain unclear. We hypothesised the existence of transcriptomic interactions, an effect that was tested in BEAS-2B and primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBECs) using formoterol and budesonide as representative LABA and ICS, respectively. In BEAS-2B cells, formoterol produced 267 (212 induced; 55 repressed) gene expression changes (>=2/<=0.5-fold) that were dominated by rapidly (1-2h) upregulated transcripts. Conversely, budesonide induced 370 and repressed 413 mRNAs, which occurred predominantly at 6-18h and were preceded by transcripts enriched in transcriptional regulators. Significantly , genes regulated by both formoterol and budesonide were overrepresented in the genome ; moreover , budesonide-plus-formoterol induced and repressed 609 and 577 mRNAs , respectively , of which ~1/3 failed the cut-off criterion for either treatment alone . While induction of many mRNAs by budesonide-plus-formoterol was supra-additive, the dominant (and potentially beneficial) effect of budesonide on formoterol-induced transcripts, including those encoding many pro-inflammatory proteins, was repression. Gene ontology analysis of the budesonide-modulated transcriptome returned enriched terms for transcription, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, development and migration. This \"functional\" ICS signature was augmented in presence of formoterol. Thus, LABAs modulate glucocorticoid action and comparable transcriptome-wide interactions in pHBECs imply that such effects may be extrapolated to asthmatics taking combination therapy. While repression of formoterol-induced pro-inflammatory mRNAs should be beneficial, the pathophysiological consequences of other interactions require investigation.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33376135/"}

HER2-targeted treatments have improved outcomes in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings; however, some patients remain at risk of relapse or death for many years after treatment of early-stage disease. Therefore, new strategies are needed. We did a phase 3 trial to assess a neoadjuvant regimen for HER2-positive breast cancer that replaces traditional systemic chemotherapy with targeted treatment. ### methods We did a randomised, open-label phase 3 KRISTINE trial in 68 Translational Research In Oncology centres (hospitals and specialty cancer centres in Asia, Europe, USA, and Canada). Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with centrally confirmed HER2-positive stage II-III operable breast cancer (>2 cm tumour size), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 55% (by echocardiogram or multiple-gated acquisition scan). We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive either trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab or docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. We did the randomisation via an interactive response system under a permuted block randomisation scheme (block size of four), stratified by hormone receptor status, stage at diagnosis, and geographical location. Patients received six cycles (every 3 weeks) of neoadjuvant trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab (trastuzumab emtansine 3\u00b76 mg/kg; pertuzumab 840 mg loading dose, 420 mg maintenance doses) or docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (docetaxel 75 mg/m ### findings Between June 25, 2014, and June 15, 2015, we randomly assigned 444 patients to neoadjuvant treatment with trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab (n=223) or docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (n=221). A pathological complete response was achieved by 99 (44\u00b74%) of 223 patients in the trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab group and 123 (55\u00b77%) of 221 patients in the docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab group (absolute difference -11\u00b73 percentage points, 95% CI -20\u00b75 to -2\u00b70; p=0\u00b7016). During neoadjuvant treatment, compared with patients receiving docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, fewer patients receiving trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab had a grade 3-4 adverse event (29 [13%] of 223 vs 141 [64%] of 219) or a serious adverse event (11 [5%] of 223 vs 63 [29%] of 219). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab group were decreased platelet count (three [1%] of 223 patients vs 11 [5%] of 219 with docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab), fatigue (three [1%] vs seven [3%]), alanine aminotransferase increase (three [1%] vs four [2%]), and hypokalaemia (three [1%] vs five [2%]). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab group were neutropenia (55 [25%] of 219 vs one [<1%] of 223 with trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab), diarrhoea (33 [15%] vs 2 [<1%]), and febrile neutropenia (33 [15%] vs 0). No deaths were reported during neoadjuvant treatment. ### interpretation Traditional neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy plus dual HER2-targeted blockade (docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab) resulted in significantly more patients achieving a pathological complete response than HER2-targeted chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted blockade (trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab); however, numerically more grade 3-4 and serious adverse events occurred in the chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab group. Further efforts to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy without imparting more toxicity are warranted. ### funding F Hoffmann-La Roche and Genentech.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29175149/"}

Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of chemotherapy in combination with different biological agents including regorafenib in second-line therapy in patients with mCRC. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to estimate the relative efficacy and safety of regorafenib in combination with chemotherapy compared to other biological agents with chemotherapy combinations. ### methods A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab, regorafenib, panitumumab, cetuximab, ramucirumab, conatumumab, ganitumab, and aflibercept in combination with chemotherapy against chemotherapy alone as second-line setting from inception to 7\u00a0February 2019 in patients with mCRC.

We compared the expression of MRP and mdrl mRNA in cell lines and tissues using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In mdrl-negative cells, the relationship between the level of MRP gene expression and sensitivity to anticancer drugs was examined. The effect of verapamil, an MRP-modulating agent, was also examined in these cells. The expression of MRP gene in gastric cancer cell lines varied from a low to a high level, but mdrl was not detected in any of these cell lines. Colon cancer cell lines expressed low to intermediate levels of MRP gene, and half of the cells co-expressed low to high levels of mdrl. In tissue samples, the expression pattern of the two multidrug resistance (MDR) genes was broadly similar to that described for the cell lines, except that most of the gastric cancer tissue samples did express low levels of mdrl.

Despite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) suppression of prostate cancer (PCa) growth, its overall effects on PCa metastasis remain unclear. Using human (C4-2B/THP1) and mouse (TRAMP-C1/RAW264.7) PCa cells-macrophages co-culture systems, we found currently used anti-androgens, MDV3100 (enzalutamide) or Casodex (bicalutamide), promoted macrophage migration to PCa cells that consequently led to enhanced PCa cell invasion. In contrast, the AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9, suppressed both macrophage migration and subsequent PCa cell invasion. Mechanism dissection showed that Casodex/MDV3100 reduced the AR-mediated PIAS3 expression and enhanced the pSTAT3-CCL2 pathway. Addition of CCR2 antagonist reversed the Casodex/MDV3100-induced macrophage migration and PCa cell invasion. In contrast, ASC-J9 could regulate pSTAT3-CCL2 signaling using two pathways: an AR-dependent pathway via inhibiting PIAS3 expression and an AR-independent pathway via direct inhibition of the STAT3 phosphorylation/activation. These findings were confirmed in the in vivo mouse model with orthotopically injected TRAMP-C1 cells. Together, these results may raise the potential concern about the currently used ADT with anti-androgens that promotes PCa metastasis and may provide some new and better therapeutic strategies using ASC-J9 alone or a combinational therapy that simultaneously targets androgens/AR signaling and PIAS3-pSTAT3-CCL2 signaling to better battle PCa growth and metastasis at castration-resistant stage.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23928703/"}

This phase 2 study was designed to examine the safety and efficacy of gemcitabine and sorafenib in patients with recurrent EOC. ### methods Patients with recurrent EOC after platinum-based chemotherapy and who had subsequently received up to 3 prior chemotherapy regimens were eligible. gemcitabine (1000 mg/m intravenous [IV]) was administered weekly for 7 of 8 weeks in the first cycle, then weekly for 3 weeks of each subsequent 4-week cycle. sorafenib (400 mg p.o. bid) was given continuously. The primary end point for this trial was objective response rate by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Secondary endpoints included Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) CA-125 response, time to progression, overall survival, and toxicity. ### results Forty-three patients were enrolled, and 33 completed at least 1 cycle. Two patients had a partial response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors objective response rate = 4.7%). Ten patients (23.3%) maintained response or stable disease for at least 6 months. GCIG CA-125 response was 27.9%. The median time to progression was 5.4 months, and the median overall survival was 13.0 months. Hematologic toxicity was common but manageable. The most common nonhematologic adverse events were hand-foot syndrome, fatigue, hypokalemia, and diarrhea. ### conclusion This trial of gemcitabine and sorafenib in recurrent EOC did not meet its primary efficacy end point, but the combination was associated with encouraging rates of prolonged stable disease and CA-125 response.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20847613/"}

We have determined the degree of sensitivity/resistance to selumetinib in a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines using cell proliferation and soft agar assays. Sensitive cell lines underwent G1 arrest, whereas selumetinib had no effect on the cell cycle of resistant cells. Some of the resistant cell lines showed high levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the absence of serum. selumetinib inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and RSK and had no effect on AKT phosphorylation in both sensitive and resistant cells. Furthermore, mutations in KRAS, BRAF, or PIK3CA were not clearly associated with selumetinib resistance. Surprisingly, selumetinib was able to inhibit phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) and its downstream target ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) in sensitive cell lines. However, p70S6K and RPS6 phosphorylation remained unaffected or even increased in resistant cells. Moreover, in some of the resistant cell lines p70S6K and RPS6 were phosphorylated in the absence of serum. Interestingly, colorectal primary cultures derived from tumours excised to patients exhibited the same behaviour than established cell lines. Pharmacological inhibition of p70S6 K using the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 , the specific mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin and the specific p70S6 K inhibitor PF-4708671 potentiated Selumetinib effects in resistant cells . In addition, biological inhibition of p70S6K using siRNA rendered responsiveness to selumetinib in resistant cell lines. Furthermore, combination of p70S6K silencing and PF-47086714 was even more effective. We can conclude that p70S6K and its downstream target RPS6 are potential biomarkers of resistance to selumetinib in colorectal cancer.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25379021/"}

With the use of combination chemotherapy as well as a wide range of symptomatic therapies (e.g. analgesics and antiemetics) for the treatment of patients with cancer, the field of oncology practises polypharmacy to an extreme degree. The risk for a drug interaction under these conditions is high, and the pharmacological characteristics of the anti-cancer drugs, such as steep dose-response curves, low therapeutic indices and severe toxicities, suggest that even small changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of the affected drug could significantly alter its toxicity or efficacy. In this review, drug interactions which quantitatively affect the absorption, distribution, biotransformation or excretion of the commonly used anticancer drugs are described. Most of the significant drug interactions involving this class of drugs occur at the level of biotransformation and excretion. For example , the renal excretion of methotrexate by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion is affected by a number of weak organic acids , such as probenecid , salicylates and penicillin , which compete for tubular secretion , resulting in delayed clearance of methotrexate . The best described example of an interaction at the level of biotransformation is the effect of allopurinol on the catabolism of 6-mercaptopurine. By inhibiting xanthine oxidase, allopurinol blocks the first-pass metabolism of 6-mercaptopurine following its oral administration, leading to a 4- to 5-fold increase in plasma concentrations. Known drug interactions may potentially be used to enhance the antitumour activity of a drug--for instance, the administration of tetrahydrouridine (a cytidine deaminase inhibitor) with cytarabine in an attempt to block its rapid inactivation to uridine arabinoside. Overall, little information is available concerning the pharmacokinetic interactions of anticancer drugs with each other and with other classes of drugs in man, in part because the high incidence of toxicity and treatment failure, and empirical dosing methods, obscure the recognition of possible interactions. Awareness on the part of the clinician and more extensive pharmacokinetic investigation will be needed to recognise, document and avoid potentially harmful pharmacokinetic drug interactions involving this class of drugs.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2426030/"}

The worldwide annual pancreatic cancer death rate equals its estimated annual incidence. Surgery has been considered the only curative modality for this disease, but only 5 to 15% of patients are candidates for potentially curative resection. Evidence that postoperative adjuvant treatment improves outcome has been limited to a single randomised trial of a well tolerated split-course chemoradiation regimen. More intensive regimens have since been developed and are associated with, at best, a modest improvement in patient outcome. The potentially significant morbidity associated with pancreaticoduodenectomy, which can compromise the delivery of postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation, has led to the development of preoperative adjuvant ('neoadjuvant') chemoradiation in these patients. Although experience suggests that such an approach is feasible, its ultimate impact awaits further evaluation. Combined modality therapy has produced the most promising results in patients with unresectable or locally advanced disease. However, only modest improvements in median survival and minimal increases in long term survival have so far been achieved. This observation has encouraged many investigators to devise innovative methods of delivering therapy, including radioisotope implantation and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). Combined modality therapy with radioisotope implantation appears to have the greatest potential for improving local control and survival in these patients. IORT may be associated with lower morbidity than radioisotope implantation, but its impact may be limited by the radiobiological disadvantage associated with single dose boost therapy. Although new radiosensitising drugs are being tested, the problem of distant metastasis remains significant. New chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine appear to have the potential to produce better results than those achieved over the last 35 years with fluorouracil . Investigations into the optimal integration of different therapeutic modalities, along with continued advances in surgery, radiation and systemic therapy, should lead to the increased use of modern multimodality interventions.

In dopamine-intact animals, both glutamate and asparate were readily detectable in EPN dialysates. Recoveries of both amino acids were increased bilaterally by local perfusion with veratridine ( 100 microM , given under halothane anaesthesia ) , pretreatment with reserpine ( 4 mg/kg , i.p . , 24 h beforehand ) , unilateral pretreatment of the medial forebrain bundle with 6-OHDA ( 8 microg/4 microl ) , and by the systemic ( 1 mg/kg , i.p . ) or bilateral intrastriatal ( 7 microg/0.5 microl under halothane anaesthesia ) administration of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol , but not raclopride ( 2 mg/kg , i.p . ) .

By contrast, the dopamine D2/3 receptor agonist quinpirole (4 mg/kg, i.p.) lowered the outputs of glutamate and aspartate in the EPN of reserpine-treated and normal individuals, whilst the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) was inactive; however, both drugs caused behavioural arousal. The dopamine D2/3 receptor agonist RU 24213 reversed reserpine-induced akinesia, yet paradoxically increased glutamate (not aspartate) output in the EPN still further. The combination of benserazide (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and L-DOPA (50 mg/kg, i.p.) evoked intense contraversive circling in unilaterally 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, together with a drop in EPN glutamate (but not aspartate) output in the intact but not lesioned hemisphere. These results offer biochemical support for the hypothesis that excitatory neurones innervating the EPN via the indirect striatal output pathway, may utilise glutamate and/or aspartate as their neurotransmitter. They further endorse the view that the EPN receives information from striatal D2 and not D1 receptors via excitatory synapses, which become hyperactive following dopamine depletion or inactivation, and which are subject to control by the contralateral as well as by the ipsilateral hemisphere. The results obtained with RU 24213 and L-DOPA, however, indicate that dopaminergic behaviours can also occur independently of glutamate or aspartate release in the EPN.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9125444/"}

Patients with advanced-stage or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer have a grim prognosis when first-line chemotherapy fails. Some cytotoxic drugs such as docetaxel and pemetrexed prolong overall survival by a few months, but at a cost of severe toxicity. crizotinib (Xalkori*, Pfizer), a drug that inhibits ALK (among other tyrosine kinases) has been authorised for use in patients whose tumours overexpress this tyrosine kinase. Preliminary results of a comparative, randomised but unblinded trial in 347 patients suggest that crizotinib delays cancer progression and death more effectively than pemetrexed or docetaxel (median 7.7 months versus 3 months). However, it remains to be seen whether or not this translates into longer overall survival. Two uncontrolled trials including 136 and 119 patients also suggest that crizotinib delays tumour progression and death by about 8 months. crizotinib is highly toxic, causing gastrointestinal, visual and hepatic disorders, cardiac arrhythmias (including QT prolongation) and pneumonia. These adverse effects were all more frequent than with docetaxel or pemetrexed . Some of these effects are more difficult to predict and manage than haematological disorders, which are the main adverse effects of docetaxel and pemetrexed. crizotinib is extensively metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and also inhibits P-glycoprotein, creating a risk of numerous pharmacokinetic interactions. Other interactions, with drugs that prolong the QT interval, may increase the risk of serious adverse effects. In practice, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer overexpressing ALK tyrosine kinase in whom first-line chemotherapy has failed, crizotinib appears to delay cancer progression and death, but at a cost of serious adverse effects.

Male and female pigmented (C57B1/6J) and nonpigmented (A/HeJ) mice were studied by whole-body autoradiography following administration of either nicotine-14C (methyl- or 2'-labeled) or nicotine-1'-N-oxide-14C. When each of these compounds was administered at the same specific activity the radioactivity retained in the bronchial epithelium was much greater for the methyl-labeled nicotine-14C than for the ring-labeled. Following administration of the N-oxide very little radioactivity was retained at this site and this was seen only at a few time intervals. Pretreatment with NaHCO3 , NH4Cl , SKF 525A , piperonyl butoxide , progesterone , cysteamine , phenobarbital or metyrapone prior to the administration of [methyl-14C]nicotine was studied . metyrapone totally prevented the accumulation of radioactivity in the bronchial epithelium and progesterone reduced this accumulation; the other substances used for pretreatment had no effect on the uptake of radioactivity. These results are interpreted to indicate that the accumulation of nicotine in bronchial epithelium is not accounted for by transcellular pH gradients but is due to a high affinity of nicotine for a cytochrome P-450 in this tissue which demethylates the nicotine. The relationship and significance of metabolism of nicotine in this tissue to metabolism at other sites in the body are discussed.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/708156/"}

However , the current artemisinin FDC products , such as \u03b2-artemether and lumefantrine , are inherently unstable and require controlled distribution and storage conditions , which are not always available in resource-limited settings . Moreover, quality control is hampered by lack of suitable analytical methods. Thus, there is a need for a rapid and simple, but stability-indicating method for the simultaneous assay of \u03b2-artemether and lumefantrine FDC products. ### methods Three reversed-phase fused-core HPLC columns (Halo RP-Amide, Halo C18 and Halo Phenyl-hexyl), all thermostated at 30\u00b0C, were evaluated. \u03b2-artemether and lumefantrine (unstressed and stressed), and reference-related impurities were injected and chromatographic parameters were assessed. Optimal chromatographic parameters were obtained using Halo RP-Amide column and an isocratic mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and 1 mM phosphate buffer pH 3.0 (52:48; V/V) at a flow of 1.0 ml/min and 3 \u03bcl injection volume. Quantification was performed at 210 nm and 335 nm for \u03b2-artemether and for lumefantrine, respectively.

A complete chromatographic run only took four minutes. Evaluation of the method, including a Plackett-Burman robustness verification within analytical QbD-principles, and real-life samples showed the method is suitable for quantitative assay purposes of both active pharmaceutical ingredients, with a mean recovery relative standard deviation (\u00b1 RSD) of 99.7 % (\u00b1 0.7%) for \u03b2-artemether and 99.7 % (\u00b1 0.6%) for lumefantrine.

This method can be applied in the routine regulatory quality control of FDC products. The in-silico toxicological investigation using Derek Nexus\u00ae indicated that the overall toxicity risk for \u03b2-artemether-related impurities is comparable to that of \u03b2-artemether API.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23631682/"}

We are approaching the end of the fifth decade and the most productive period in the development of chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We began this decade by establishing cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimens of the 1980s as effective at improving survival for patients with advanced disease. The observed improvement in survival from these trials appears to be primarily attributed to cisplatin. Furthermore, this decade, unlike the prior, has identified an abundance of novel active agents for the treatment of this disease. Vinorelbine , gemcitabine , docetaxel , paclitaxel , and irinotecan are all new chemotherapeutic agents which have shown promising activity in this disease . In contrast to the cisplatin-based chemotherapy trials of the 1980s, these newer chemotherapeutic agents when given in combination with cisplatin add to the survival outcomes for these patients. With these survival advances has come a focus on chemotherapy-induced adverse events, lung cancer symptom management, and overall quality of life.

The phenomenon of co-localization of transcriptionally upregulated genes showing similar expression levels is known across all eukaryotic genomes. We recently mapped the Aroclor 1254-regulated transcriptome back onto the genome and provided evidence for the statistically significant co-localization of regulated genes. They did, however, not always show similar expression levels, and many of the regulated genes were, in fact, repressed. ### results In this study, we were able to reproduce this observation with microarray data stemming from 1) human hepatocytes treated with the gyrase and potential topoisomerase II inhibitor trovafloxacin, 2) human hepatocytes treated with the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin and 3) mouse lymphoma cells treated with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. We found statistically significant co-localization of regulated gene pairs--induced and repressed--within the window size of 0-100 kbp. Notably, by using microarray data stemming from lung tissue of a mouse transgenic line overexpressing the transcription factor c-myc, which served as a negative control, we found regulated genes to be located with regard to each other nearly in the same way as genes distributed randomly all over the genome (0-100 kbp). ### conclusion We suggest topoisomerase II inhibition by Aroclor 1254 , trovafloxacin , doxorubicin , and etoposide to be responsible for significant co-localization of regulated genes through the inability of the stabilized enzyme complexes to religate DNA . Within the permanently opened chromatin domains, neighbored genes might be allowed to be regulated. Overexpression of c-myc, however, does not inhibit topoisomerase II activity. Consequently, the enzyme is able to perform its normal function of transiently breaking and rejoining the DNA double strand.

In this article, we aimed to comprehensively review recent insights in the therapeutic management of gastric cancer, with focus on the surgical and perioperative management of resectable forms, and the latest advances regarding advanced diseases. Surgical improvements comprise the use of laparoscopic surgery including staging laparoscopy, a better definition of nodal dissection, and the development of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The best individualized perioperative management should be assessed before curative-intent surgery for all patients and can consists in perioperative chemotherapy, adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy alone. The optimal timing and sequence of chemotherapy and radiation therapy with respect to surgery should be further explored. Patients with advanced gastric cancer have a poor prognosis. Nevertheless, they can benefit from doublet or triplet chemotherapy combination, including trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients. Upon progression, second-line therapy can be considered in patients with good performance status. Although anti-HER2 ( trastuzumab ) and anti-VEGFR ( ramucirumab ) may yield survival benefit , anti-EGFR and anti-HGFR therapies have failed to improve outcomes .

Hydrogen peroxide led to iron release (as measured by iron/bathophenanthroline complex) from the microsomes prepared from LLC-PK1 cells. cimetidine, which inhibits cytochrome P-450 by interacting with the heme iron, significantly blocked iron release, whereas ranitidine, which has a similar structure as cimetidine but is a weak inhibitor of P-450, did not have an effect (H2O2, 0.42 +/- 0.04; H2O2 + cimetidine, 0.23 +/- 0.02 nmol/mg protein; N = 4, P < 0.01).

The objective of this phase II study was to determine the efficacy and toxicity of a combination of carboplatin and etoposide as salvage treatment, in previously treated patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer following first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy. ### Patients And Methods From July 1990 to August 1994, 58 patients were treated with 3-week cycles of chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin (200 mg/m2, D1) and etoposide (120 mg/m2, D1, D2). Criteria for evaluating previous response to cisplatin were strictly defined. ### results The overall response rate was 36%, with five complete responses (CR, 9%), 16 partial responses (PR, 27%) and the median duration of response was 10 months (range: 4 to 38). In the group of patients who progressed during the first year following the diagnosis, the response was 1 CR and 2 PR (12%) and in the group of patients who progressed from the second year after diagnosis, 4 CR and 14 PR (56%), with a median survival of 8.5 and 21 months respectively (p = 0.0013).

Myelotoxicity was the main side-effect but did not appear to be cumulative. Grade 3 and grade 4 anemia were observed in 26% and 3% of the patients respectively, neutropenia in 14% and 2% and thrombocytopenia in 14% and 8.5%. One patient died of sepsis associated with neutropenia. ### conclusion Treatment was easily manageable and well tolerated. The advantage of carboplatin and etoposide combination in potentially responsive patients is represented by the reduced nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and ototoxicity as compared with cisplatin containing regimen, with durable feasibility in outpatients. This second-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is effective as salvage treatment in potentially responsive patients with late recurrent tumors, while paclitaxel is the drug of choice for patients who have developped primary or secondary resistance to platin therapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8680083/"}

Overexpression of the family of HER receptors have been associated with a variety of malignancies; the first and best studied is the association of overexpression of the HER2/neu receptor with a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype and poorer survival. A humanized antibody to HER2/neu, trastuzumab, is now FDA approved for the treatment of early stage, HER2/neu overexpressing breast cancer sequenced with chemotherapy including doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel. Additional international and national studies support the significant impact of trastuzumab on both disease free and overall survival in women with this aggressive form of breast cancer. Toxicity includes a low but clear risk of congestive heart failure, and the large phase III trials have helped to determine which patients are at higher risk for this complication. Non-anthracycline containing regimens are an alternative therapy associated with reduced cardiac toxicity. trastuzumab therapy is now the standard of care for the treatment of early stage, HER2/neu positive breast cancer given in combination with one of several chemotherapy regimens. Ongoing questions include the appropriate duration of trastuzumab treatment as well as the optimal chemotherapy regimen and sequence. The next large phase III adjuvant trial for this subset of breast cancer is an international collaboration designed to evaluate the added or alternative benefit of an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting HER2/neu as well as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), lapatinib.

Two (4%) had disease progression (one after the fourth cycle and one after the sixth cycle). All 52 (91%, lower limit of one-sided 95% CI 85%) remaining patients achieved complete response at the end of treatment. 23 (40%, upper limit of one-sided 95% CI 53%) of 57 patients had at least one episode of relevant toxicity. The most frequent grade 3-4 haematological toxicities were neutropenia (149 [49%] of 304 cycles) and thrombocytopenia (158 [52%]). Most treatment-related non-haematological adverse events were of grade 1-2, with the most frequent ones being fatigue (14 [25%] patients), nausea or vomiting (12 [21%]), and infusion-related reactions or tumour lysis syndrome (12 [21%]). 41 (72%) patients required a dose reduction. 12 patients died during the study, but no deaths were related to treatment. ### interpretation RBAC500 is an effective treatment for elderly patients with mantle cell lymphoma and, despite not meeting our prespecified safety boundary, haematological toxicity was manageable with appropriate supportive care and dose reduction. Since maintenance therapy is not required, RBAC500 could be considered an option and should be studied in phase 3 trials. ### funding Fondazione Italiana Linfomi and Mundipharma.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927586/"}

The aim of this study was to assess in a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials the safety and efficacy of gliclazide compared to other oral glucose-lowering agents (PROSPERO2013:CRD42013004156). ### Data Sources Medline, EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.gov, Trialregister.nl, Clinicaltrialsregister.eu and the Cochrane database. ### selection Included were randomized studies of at least 12 weeks duration with the following outcomes: HbA1c change, incidence of severe hypoglycemia, weight change, cardiovascular events and/or mortality when comparing gliclazide with other oral blood glucose lowering drugs. Bias was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The inverse variance random effects model was used. ### results Nineteen trials were included; 3,083 patients treated with gliclazide and 3,155 patients treated with other oral blood glucose lowering drugs. There was a considerable amount of heterogeneity between and bias in studies. Compared to other glucose lowering agents except metformin , gliclazide was slightly more effective ( -0.13 % ( 95%CI : -0.25 , -0.02 , I(2 ) 55 % ) ) . One out of 2,387 gliclazide users experienced a severe hypoglycemic event, whilst also using insulin.

Few studies reported differences in weight and none were designed to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes. ### conclusions The methodological quality of randomized trials comparing gliclazide to other oral glucose lowering agents was poor and effect estimates on weight were limited by publication bias. The number of severe hypoglycemic episodes was extremely low, and gliclazide appears at least equally effective compared to other glucose lowering agents.

Although nicotine is generally considered to be the main psychoactive component of tobacco, growing evidence highlights the importance of nonnicotine compounds in smoking reinforcement. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition is a major consequence of smoking and MAO inhibitors, such as tranylcypromine, increase nicotine reinforcement. tranylcypromine has multiple pharmacological effects, increasing monoamine release for a few hours immediately after its administration and blocking MAO activity for several days. To assess the relative role of these two actions, adult male rats were tested in consecutive daily 3-h sessions for self-administration of nicotine (3 \u03bcg kg\u207b\u00b9) inj\u207b\u00b9, i.v.) either 20 or 1 h following administration of tranylcypromine (3 mg kg\u207b\u00b9). Both paradigms were shown to produce highly significant inhibition of MAO activity. However, whereas animals readily acquired self-administration when pretreated with tranylcypromine 1 h prior to testing, they did not with the longer pretreatment interval. Such animals did immediately acquire nicotine self-administration when the tranylcypromine pretreatment interval was switched to 1 h prior to testing on Day 4, indicating that an acute effect of the MAO inhibitor was responsible for enhanced nicotine reinforcement. Several lines of evidence implicate serotonin ( 5-HT ) as the mediator of this enhancement : ( 1 ) Tranyclypromine-enhanced nicotine reinforcement was blocked by the 5-HT\u2082 receptor antagonists , ritanserin and ketanserin ; ( 2 ) parachloroamphetamine ( PCA ) , a 5-HT releaser , also enhanced nicotine self-administration in animals in which MAO activity was inhibited ; ( 3 ) pretreatment with tranylcypromine increased PCA-induced 5-HT overflow in the nucleus accumbens .

Conventional models for predicting the fate of xenobiotic organic trace chemicals, identified, and calibrated using data obtained in batch experiments spiked with reference substances, can be limited in predicting xenobiotic removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). At stake is the level of model complexity required to adequately describe a general theory of xenobiotic removal in WWTPs. In this article, we assess the factors that influence the removal of diclofenac and carbamazepine in activated sludge, and evaluate the complexity required for the model to effectively predict their removal. The results are generalized to previously published cases. Batch experimental results, obtained under anoxic and aerobic conditions, were used to identify extensions to, and to estimate parameter values of the activated sludge modeling framework for Xenobiotic trace chemicals (ASM-X). Measurement and simulation results obtained in the batch experiments , spiked with the diclofenac and carbamazepine content of preclarified municipal wastewater shows comparably high biotransformation rates in the presence of growth substrates . Forward dynamic simulations were performed using full-scale data obtained from Bekkelaget WWTP (Oslo, Norway) to evaluate the model and to estimate the level of re-transformable xenobiotics present in the influent. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that xenobiotic loading conditions can significantly influence the removal capacity of WWTPs. We show that the trace chemical retransformation in upstream sewer pipes can introduce considerable error in assessing the removal efficiency of a WWTP, based only on parent compound concentration measurements. The combination of our data with those from the literature shows that solids retention time (SRT) can enhance the biotransformation of diclofenac, which was not the case for carbamazepine. Model approximation of the xenobiotic concentration, detected in the solid phase, suggest that between approximately 1% and 16% of the total solid carbamazepine and diclofenac concentrations, respectively, is due to sorption-the remainder being non-bioavailable and sequestered. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model's predictive power over conventional tools in a statistical analysis, performed at four levels of structural complexity. To assess WWTP retrofitting needs to remove xenobiotic trace chemicals, we suggest using mechanistic models, e.g., ASM-X, in regional risk assessments. For preliminary evaluations, we present operating charts that can be used to estimate average xenobiotic removal rates in WWTPs as a function of SRT and the xenobiotics mass loads normalised to design treatment capacity.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22565415/"}

Because the INJECT trial provided a probability of 0.95 that the mortality rate associated with reteplase use would be either lower than that with streptokinase administration or at most 0.73% worse, reteplase and streptokinase were proved equivalent according to the trial definition and limits.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11824001/"}

Anti-CD20 therapy was effective on marginal zone B cells, in the murine model for human CD20 expression only when preceded by anti-BAFF therapy. The possible efficacy of a sequential anti-BAFF/anti-CD20 therapy in SS was investigated. ### methods We treated with belimumab, a monoclonal anti-BAFF antibody, and soon after with rituximab a patient with severe, refractory SS, parotid low-grade B-cell MALT lymphoma and cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis. Previous treatments with rituximab and with rituximab plus high dose glucocorticoids , as well as with cyclophosphamide , azathioprine , plasma exchange , hyperbaric therapy , VAC therapy , prostacyclin , mycophenolate mofetil and surgery , had previously failed .

This led to the search for new antimalarials without cross resistance with chloroquine. For each new drug, one of the major concerns was to define how rapidly parasites would develop resistance to this compound. Drug combinations were taken into consideration so as to achieve a delay in the appearance of resistance. The decision to test a triple combination has led to the development of Fansimef , a fixed combination with tablets containing 250 mg mefloquine , 500 mg sulfadoxine and 25 mg pyrimethamine . A very relevant delay in the development of resistance was found both in-vivo--in the P. berghei model--and in-vitro using P. falciparum. Fansimef has also been under investigations for malaria. Controlled clinical trials were performed in Africa, South America and South East Asia. The documentation for this new indication will be submitted to registration authorities in 1991. A preference alternative to continuous chemoprophylaxis is stand-by malaria treatment for travellers to regions where the malaria risk is relatively low. Stand-by treatment is under investigations in France and in Switzerland. In the search for alternative remedies against drug resistant P. falciparum malaria our attention was directed to Yingzhaosu, a new sesquiterpene peroxide of plant origin from traditional Chinese medicine.

Cultured cells and xenografts were evaluated for effects of these drugs on proliferation, signaling, and cell death, and assessment of synergy. ### results In neuroblastoma murine xenografts harboring the most common ALK mutations, including those mutations associated with resistance to crizotinib (but not in those with wild-type ALK), crizotinib combined with topo/cyclo enhanced tumor responses and mouse event-free survival. crizotinib + topo/cyclo showed synergistic cytotoxicity and higher caspase-dependent apoptosis than crizotinib or topo/cyclo alone in neuroblastoma cell lines with ALK aberrations (mutation or amplification). ### conclusions Combining crizotinib with chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in treating newly diagnosed patients with high-risk neuroblastoma restores sensitivity in preclinical models harboring both sensitive ALK aberrations and de novo-resistant ALK mutations. These data support clinical testing of crizotinib and conventional chemotherapy with the goal of integrating ALK inhibition into multiagent therapy for ALK-aberrant neuroblastoma patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26438783/"}

The effectiveness of pharmacological treatment and rehabilitation management in PPS is not yet established. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. ### objectives To systematically review the evidence from randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials for the effect of any pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment for PPS compared to placebo, usual care or no treatment. ### Search Methods We searched the following databases on 21 July 2014: Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL Plus. We also checked reference lists of all relevant articles, searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database and trial registers and contacted investigators known to be involved in research in this area. ### Selection Criteria Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of any form of pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment for people with PPS. The primary outcome was self perceived activity limitations and secondary outcomes were muscle strength, muscle endurance, fatigue, pain and adverse events. ### Data Collection And Analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. ### Main Results We included 10 pharmacological ( modafinil , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) , pyridostigmine , lamotrigine , amantadine , prednisone ) and three non-pharmacological ( muscle strengthening , rehabilitation in a warm climate ( that is temperature \u00b1 25 \u00b0 C , dry and sunny ) and a cold climate ( that is temperature \u00b1 0 \u00b0 C , rainy or snowy ) , static magnetic fields ) studies with a total of 675 participants with PPS in this review . None of the included studies were completely free from any risk of bias, the most prevalent risk of bias being lack of blinding.There was moderate- and low-quality evidence that IVIg has no beneficial effect on activity limitations in the short term and long term, respectively, and inconsistency in the evidence for effectiveness on muscle strength. IVIg caused minor adverse events in a substantial proportion of the participants. Results of one trial provided very low-quality evidence that lamotrigine might be effective in reducing pain and fatigue, resulting in fewer activity limitations without generating adverse events. Data from two single trials suggested that muscle strengthening of thumb muscles (very low-quality evidence) and static magnetic fields (moderate-quality evidence) are safe and beneficial for improving muscle strength and pain, respectively, with unknown effects on activity limitations. Finally, there was evidence varying from very low quality to high quality that modafinil, pyridostigmine, amantadine, prednisone and rehabilitation in a warm or cold climate are not beneficial in PPS. ### Authors Conclusions Due to insufficient good-quality data and lack of randomised studies, it was impossible to draw definite conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions for PPS. Results indicated that IVIg, lamotrigine, muscle strengthening exercises and static magnetic fields may be beneficial but need further investigation to clarify whether any real and meaningful effect exists.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25984923/"}

Similar data are emerging in childhood cancers, for which selinexor is being evaluated in early phase clinical studies.

The traditional Asian diet is rich in soy products may explain in part why the incidence of breast cancer in Asian women is relatively low. To improve therapeutic benefits, we investigated the combination of genistein with chemotherapeutic agents in phenotypically dissimilar human breast cancer cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, in which estrogen receptor expression is positive and negative, respectively. In the present study, genistein significantly decreased cell apoptosis induced by tubulin-binding agents, paclitaxel and vincristine. FACScan analysis revealed that genistein also diminished the accumulation of the G2/M phase in the cell cycle caused by tubulin-binding agents. In situ staining of microtubules revealed that genistein could decrease paclitaxel-induced tubulin polymerization. However, in vivo tubulin polymerization assay revealed that simultaneous treatment of genistein did not change the tubulin/microtubule dynamic. Genistein reduced Bcl-2 phosphorylation triggered by paclitaxel and vincristine without changing Bax protein expression . p53 and p21 expression, monitored by Western blotting, was not altered by genistein.

In this study, we investigated adaptive mechanisms associated with aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance in breast cancer cells and show that sensitivity to AIs can be extended through dual inhibition of estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal receptor-2 (Her-2) signaling. We used human ER-positive breast cancer cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (MCF-7Ca). These cells grow as tumors in nude mice and are inhibited by AIs. Despite continued treatment, tumors eventually become insensitive to AI letrozole. The cells isolated from these long-term letrozole-treated tumors (LTLT-Ca) were found to have decreased ERalpha levels. Our results suggest that LTLT-Ca cells survive estrogen deprivation by activation of Her-2/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Here, we show that trastuzumab (antibody against Her-2; IC(50) = 0.4 mg/mL) was very effective in restoring the ERalpha levels and sensitivity of LTLT-Ca cells to endocrine therapy by down-regulation of Her-2/MAPK pathway and up-regulation of ERalpha. In contrast, trastuzumab was ineffective in the parental hormone-responsive MCF-7Ca cells (IC(50) = 4.28 mg/mL) and xenografts. By blocking Her-2, trastuzumab also up-regulates ERalpha and aromatase expression and hypersensitized MCF-7Ca cells to E(2). We show that trastuzumab is beneficial in hormone-refractory cells and xenografts by restoring ER, implicating Her-2 as a negative regulator of ERalpha. In xenograft studies , the combination of trastuzumab plus letrozole is equally effective in inhibiting growth of MCF-7Ca tumors as letrozole alone .

The presence of residues of antimicrobial substances in milk may have serious toxicological and technical consequences. To date, few studies have been done to evaluate the effect of heat treatments on \u03b2-lactam residues in milk. However, the few studies that have been conducted estimate losses of antimicrobial activity under different combinations of temperature and time using microbiological methods. The aims of this study were to calculate the kinetic parameters for the degradation of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in milk and to develop prediction models to estimate the concentration losses of these compounds in conventional dairy heat treatments. To do so, we employed a quantitative HPLC method to calculate losses in concentrations of 10 \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in milk with different combinations of temperature and time. Increasing the temperature from 60 \u00b0 C to 100 \u00b0 C decreased the half-life of amoxicillin ( 372 to 50 min ) , ampicillin ( 741 to 26 min ) , cloxacillin ( 367 to 46 min ) , and penicillin G ( 382 to 43 min ) .

Administration of intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g and clindamycin 900 mg precipitated symptoms of acute verapamil toxicity in this patient. The toxicity led to complete heart block requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and insertion of a temporary pacemaker. He spontaneously reverted to normal sinus rhythm after 16 hours. Subsequent cardiac evaluation, including echocardiogram, 48-hour dynamic electrocardiographic recording (Holter), and exercise stress test were normal. The patient has remained in sinus rhythm for more than one year after this episode. ### conclusions We believe that junctional rhythm on admission was a result of chronic verapamil toxicity. This may have been because of increased bioavailability of the drug or increased sensitivity of the receptors. Administration of ceftriaxone, clindamycin, or both agents might have precipitated acute verapamil toxicity by displacing verapamil from its protein-binding sites. Extreme caution is necessary when a highly protein-bound drug is given to a patient already receiving verapamil.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8364267/"}

Fifteen patients permanently ceased therapy (PCT) because of toxicity (PCTTOX ), most commonly diarrhea/colitis (n = 7), at a median of 11 months after commencing treatment. PCTTOX was associated with a higher risk of subsequent disease progression (hazard ratio, 6.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.77-16.15) relative to that observed in patients who remained on therapy.

In this study we compared volasertib, volasertib with pemetrexed, and pemetrexed alone in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease progressed after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. ### Patients And Methods A run-in phase (n = 12) was used to determine whether volasertib could be combined in full dose with pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2). Subsequent patients were randomized to volasertib (n = 37), volasertib with pemetrexed (n = 47), or pemetrexed (n = 47) administered on day 1 every 21 days. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points included objective response rate and pharmacokinetics. ### results volasertib 300 mg was chosen for the randomized phase. Recruitment to single-agent volasertib was stopped early because of lack of efficacy. Median PFS was 5.3 months with pemetrexed compared with 3.3 months with volasertib with pemetrexed (hazard ratio [HR], 1.141; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.771) and 1.4 months with volasertib (HR, 2.045; 95% CI, 1.27-3.292). ORRs were 10.6% with pemetrexed, 21.3% for volasertib with pemetrexed, and 8.1% with volasertib. The most common all-grade related adverse events (pemetrexed/volasertib with pemetrexed/volasertib) were: fatigue (28 [61%]/27 [59%]/11 [31%]), nausea (21 [46%]/19 [41%]/0 [0%]), decreased apetite (14 [31%]/13 [28%]/2 [6%]), neutropenia (4 [9%]/8 [17%]/9 [25%]), rash (9 [20%]/8 [17%]/2 [6%]), vomiting (6 [13%]/13 [28%]/0 [0%]), and diarrhea (8 [17%]/11 [24%]/0 [0%]).

After the first course of treatment , a statistically significant improvement ( p = 0.002 ) in the psychological subscale scores was observed after ondansetron compared with metoclopramide . No differences were observed in the physical or functional activity subscales after the first course. However, the quality of life results over the series of courses revealed a more pronounced difference in favour of ondansetron in the psychological subscale scores (p less than 0.001) as well as trends in favour of ondansetron in the physical (p = 0.096) and functional activity (p = 0.056) subscales. Extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in 19% of patients in the metoclopramide group and resulted in 15% of patients withdrawing from their randomised anti-emetic schedule, either during or between treatment courses. Other adverse events were generally minor in nature and did not necessitate withdrawal from treatment. In conclusion, this study shows that ondansetron is significantly superior to metoclopramide (each with a single pre-treatment dose of dexamethasone) in the control of emesis over 6 courses of chemotherapy for breast cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1387929/"}

Three cycles of chemotherapy using paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC 5.0) were administered every 3 weeks for CCR therapy, and three cycles of consolidation chemotherapy using paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC 5.0) were used every 3 weeks after CCR. ### results The complete and partial response rates were 77.8% and 22.2% in group 2.

The MLL gene located at 11q23 is frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocation in a wide spectrum of newly diagnosed acute leukemias. Recently, it has become apparent that the MLL gene is very frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations in patients with secondary leukemias associated with chemotherapeutic regimens incorporating topoisomerase II inhibitors. These secondary leukemias associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors ( most commonly teniposide , etoposide , or doxorubicin ) have distinct clinical and biologic features which have led to the speculation that they are induced by treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors . We have identified a site within the MLL breakpoint cluster region (bcr) that is highly sensitive to double-strand DNA cleavage induced by topoisomerase II inhibitors. This finding is quite specific and highly reproducible. Although it was initially discovered in malignant lymphoblasts isolated from a patient receiving multiagent chemotherapy, this site-specific double-strand DNA cleavage can be induced in tissue culture using malignant cell lines as well as peripheral blood from normal individuals. Site-specific cleavage occurs in a significant fraction of cells using a variety of model systems, is both time and dose dependent, and can be induced with either doxorubicin or etoposide. This site-specific cleavage maps to the same region as a consensus topoisomerase II cleavage site within the MLL bcr. These results suggest that site specific cleavage within the MLL bcr induced by topoisomerase II inhibitors may be an early step leading to MLL translocations and secondary leukemia.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8639880/"}

Recently, evidence has been accumulated that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising target for cancer therapy. Several reports indicate that EGFRs are expressed frequently in HCC, most likely contributing to the aggressive growth characteristics of these tumors. ### methods erlotinib, an inhibitor of EGFR-tyrosine kinase, potently suppresses the growth of various tumors, but its effect on HCC remains to be explored. We therefore studied the antineoplastic potency of erlotinib in human HCC cells (Huh-7 and HepG2 cell lines). ### results We show that erlotinib inhibited HCC growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

Patients were eligible to cross over at progression.

TTP duration for those patients who crossed over was similar, but overwhelmingly vinorelbine had fewer significant grade 3-4 toxicities than docetaxel. Only two previous randomized studies have compared the efficacy of single agent docetaxel and vinorelbine following prior anthracycline exposure, one in an unselected population [16], and the other, HERNATA, in HER2 positive disease with trastuzumab used in both arms [17]. The patients randomized in this study were relatively heavily pretreated with the majority having received 2-3 lines of prior treatment for their metastatic disease. The lower response rates with vinorelbine as compared to docetaxel in this study concur with results reported in other studies [16]. However, the numbers in both this study and the other unselected study [16] are small and need to be interpreted with caution. With regard to toxicity, in the present study, grade 3-4 hematological adverse events and infection were tenfold greater with docetaxel as compared with vinorelbine, consistent with results in HERNATA [17]. While others have reported a significantly higher number of overall grade 3-4 toxicities with vinorelbine [16], the fact that, as in HERNATA, discontinuations due to toxicities in that study [16] were significantly greater with docetaxel as compared to vinorelbine suggests either the toxicity data collected did not reflect the true toxicities on treatment or that docetaxel toxicities were in some way more severe or protracted leading to more numerous discontinuations [16]. Larger randomized studies are needed to determine (1) the efficacy of docetaxel versus vinorelbine in anthracycline pretreated disease and (2) the efficacy of vinorelbine after prior taxane exposure, and particularly how it may compares both with regard to efficacy and tolerability with other possible regimens that may utilized such as carboplatin-gemcitabine [20] or eribulin [21]. The longer as well as comparable TTP at cross over for both agents compared to that upfront suggests there may be enrichment at cross over of a group of patients who are not only fit for further treatment but are more likely to a derive continued benefit from additional treatment.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23002126/"}

Inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC ) is a rare , aggressive form of breast cancer associated with HER2 amplification , with high risk of metastasis and an estimated median survival of 2.9 y. We performed an open-label , single-arm phase II clinical trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01325428 ) to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib , an irreversible ErbB family inhibitor , alone and in combination with vinorelbine in patients with HER2-positive IBC . This trial included prospectively planned exome analysis before and after afatinib monotherapy. ### Methods And Findings HER2-positive IBC patients received afatinib 40 mg daily until progression, and thereafter afatinib 40 mg daily and intravenous vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 weekly. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit; secondary endpoints were objective response (OR), duration of OR, and progression-free survival (PFS). Of 26 patients treated with afatinib monotherapy, clinical benefit was achieved in 9 patients (35%), 0 of 7 trastuzumab-treated patients and 9 of 19 trastuzumab-na\u00efve patients. Following disease progression, 10 patients received afatinib plus vinorelbine, and clinical benefit was achieved in 2 of 4 trastuzumab-treated and 0 of 6 trastuzumab-na\u00efve patients. All patients had treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Whole-exome sequencing of tumour biopsies taken before treatment and following disease progression on afatinib monotherapy was performed to assess the mutational landscape of IBC and evolutionary trajectories during therapy. Compared to a cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with HER2-positive non-IBC, HER2-positive IBC patients had significantly higher mutational and neoantigenic burden, more frequent gain-of-function TP53 mutations and a recurrent 11q13.5 amplification overlapping PAK1. Planned exploratory analysis revealed that trastuzumab-na\u00efve patients with tumours harbouring somatic activation of PI3K/Akt signalling had significantly shorter PFS compared to those without (p = 0.03). High genomic concordance between biopsies taken before and following afatinib resistance was observed with stable clonal structures in non-responding tumours, and evidence of branched evolution in 8 of 9 tumours analysed. Recruitment to the trial was terminated early following the LUX-Breast 1 trial, which showed that afatinib combined with vinorelbine had similar PFS and OR rates to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine but shorter overall survival (OS), and was less tolerable. The main limitations of this study are that the results should be interpreted with caution given the relatively small patient cohort and the potential for tumour sampling bias between pre- and post-treatment tumour biopsies. ### conclusions afatinib, with or without vinorelbine, showed activity in trastuzumab-na\u00efve HER2-positive IBC patients in a planned subgroup analysis. HER2-positive IBC is characterized by frequent TP53 gain-of-function mutations and a high mutational burden. The high mutational load associated with HER2-positive IBC suggests a potential role for checkpoint inhibitor therapy in this disease. ### Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01325428.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27923043/"}

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare epithelial neoplasm, with a high tendency for local invasion and distant metastases, with limited treatment options. Surgical treatment is the method of choice. For decades, the mainstay of pharmacological treatment has been the adrenolytic drug mitotane, in combination with chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is the latest revolution in cancer therapy, however preliminary data with single immune checkpoint inhibitors showed a modest activity in ACC patients. The anti-neoplastic activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated-antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4), anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1), and anti-PD-ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibodies in different solid tumors has aroused interest to explore the potential therapeutic effect in ACC as well. Multiple ongoing clinical trials are currently evaluating the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in ACC ( pembrolizumab , combination pembrolizumab and relacorilant , nivolumab , combination nivolumab and ipilimumab ) . The primary and acquired resistance to immunotherapy continue to counter treatment efficacy. Therefore, attempts are made to combine therapy: anti-PD-1 antibody and anti-CTLA-4 antibody, anti-PD-1 antibody and antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor. The inhibitors of immune checkpoints would benefit patients with antitumor immunity activated by radiotherapy.

As antibiotic residue becomes more and more serious all over the world, a rapid and effective detection method is needed to evaluate the antibiotic residue in feed matrices to ensure food safety for consumers. In this study, three different kinds of fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, enrofloxacin, and ofloxacin) in feed matrices were analyzed using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, respectively. Meanwhile, pure fluoroquinolones and pure feed matrices were also measured in the same way. Then, the absorption spectra of all of the samples were extracted in the transmission mode. Pure norfloxacin has two absorption peaks at 0.825 and 1.187\u00a0THz, and they could still be observed when mixing norfloxacin with feed matrices. Also, there was an obvious and strong absorption peak for ofloxacin at 1.044\u00a0THz. However, no obvious absorption peak for enrofloxacin was observed, and only a weak absorption peak was located at 0.8\u00a0THz. Then, the different models were established with different chemometrics to identify the fluoroquinolones in feed matrices and determined the fluoroquinolones content in the feed matrices. The least squares support vector machines, Naive Bayes, Mahalanobis distance, and back propagation neural network (BPNN) were used to build the identification model with a Savitzky-Golay filter and standardized normal variate pretreatments. The results show that the excellent classification model was acquired with the BPNN combined with no pretreatment. The optimal classification accuracy was 80.56% in the testing set. After that, multiple linear regression and stepwise regression were used to establish the quantitative detection model for different kinds of fluoroquinolones in feed matrices. The optimal correlation coefficients for norfloxacin , enrofloxacin , and ofloxacin in the prediction set were obtained with multiple linear regression that combined absorption peaks with wavelengths selected by stepwise regression , which were 0.867 , 0.828 , and 0.964 , respectively . Overall, this research explored the potential of identifying the fluoroquinolones in feed matrices using THz spectroscopy without a complex pretreatment process and then quantitatively detecting the fluoroquinolones content in feed matrices. The results demonstrate that THz spectra could be used to identify fluoroquinolones in feed matrices and also detect their content quantitatively, which has great significance for the food safety industry.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29400779/"}

The therapeutic activity of a wide variety of drugs is significantly improved when their longevity in the circulation is extended by encapsulation in liposomes. To improve the retention of cationic drugs in liposomes, we have investigated the effect of the cationic lipid stearylamine on the permeability of the calcium channel blocker verapamil and the antipsychotic drug prochlorperazine, both of which are also multidrug resistance modulators. Both drugs were efficiently incorporated into liposomes composed of DSPC/cholesterol that possessed a transmembrane pH gradient (inside acidic). However, the efflux of the loaded drugs was relatively rapid (i.e., 50% of the encapsulated verapamil was released after 4 h at 37 degrees C), despite the presence of a 3 unit pH gradient (pHi = 4.0, pHo = 7.5). Drug retention within the liposomes was improved by increasing the magnitude of the transmembrane pH gradient to approx. 5 units (pHi = 2.0, pHo = 7.5). Further improvements in drug retention were achieved by the addition of 10 mol% of the cationic lipid stearylamine in the DSPC/cholesterol liposomes. The combination of the 5 unit pH gradient and stearylamine resulted in increases of the retention of verapamil and prochlorperazine by approx. 20- and 5-fold, respectively. Calculation of the permeability coefficients for the charged (cationic) and neutral forms of the drugs indicated that the neutral forms of both drugs were approx. 10(4)-fold more permeable than were the cationic forms of the drugs. Further, the presence of stearylamine reduced the permeability coefficient for the cationic species of the drugs by approximately an order of magnitude, but had no effect on the neutral species of the drugs. The efflux curves observed for both verapamil and prochlorperazine could be mathematically modeled by assuming that the primary influence of stearylamine was on the development of a positive surface charge density on the inner monolayer of the liposome. Taken in sum, these results indicate that stearylamine is effective at decreasing the leakage of cationic drugs from liposomes, and may prove to be a valuable component of liposomal drug formulations.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7548129/"}

The analysis of in vitro anti-malarial drug susceptibility testing is vulnerable to the effects of different statistical approaches and selection biases.

Two statistical approaches for estimating the drug concentration associated with 50% effect (EC50 ) were compared: the commonly used standard two-stage (STS) method, and nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. The in vitro concentration-effect relationships for , chloroquine , mefloquine , lumefantrine and artesunate , were derived from clinical isolates obtained from patients on the western border of Thailand . All isolates were genotyped for polymorphisms in the pfmdr1 gene. The EC50 estimates were similar for the two statistical approaches but 15-28% of isolates in the STS method had a high coefficient of variation (>15%) for individual estimates of EC50 and these isolates had EC50 values that were 32 to 66% higher than isolates derived with more precision. In total 41% (202/490) of isolates had amplification of pfmdr1 and single nucleotide polymorphisms were found in 50 (10%). Pfmdr1 amplification was associated with an increase in EC50 for mefloquine (139% relative increase in EC50 for 2 copies, 188% for 3+ copies), lumefantrine (82% and 75% for 2 and 3+ copies respectively) and artesunate (63% and 127% for 2 and 3+ copies respectively).

Sample size calculations showed that to demonstrate an EC50 shift of 50% or more with 80% power if the prevalence was 10% would require 430 isolates and 245 isolates if the prevalence was 20%. In conclusion, although nonlinear mixed-effects modelling did not demonstrate any major advantage for determining estimates of anti-malarial drug susceptibility, the method includes all isolates, thereby, potentially improving confirmation of candidate molecular markers of anti-malarial drug susceptibility.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23894496/"}

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of dronedarone (Multaq\u00ae, Sanofi-Aventis Limited, UK) to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of the anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter, as part of the Institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics, both at the University of York, were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions regarding the use of dronedarone within the UK NHS. The ERG review comprised a critique of the submitted evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of dronedarone. The ERG examined the search strategy used to obtain relevant evidence, the selection of studies included in the assessment, outcome measures chosen and statistical methods employed. The ERG also validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model and used it to explore the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results to key assumptions. The main clinical effectiveness evidence supporting the use of dronedarone as a treatment for AF came from four randomized controlled trials. These trials were compared with a broader set of trials examining the effectiveness of other AADs for AF : amiodarone , sotalol and class 1c agents ( flecainide and propafenone ) . The evidence suggested that all AADs decreased the recurrence of AF but dronedarone had the smallest effect. A mixed treatment comparison analysis of the trials showed that dronedarone was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality than other AADs, but this was highly uncertain. There was limited evidence to assess the effect of dronedarone on stroke, and no statistically significant differences between dronedarone and other AADs were found for treatment discontinuation. From the evidence presented by the manufacturer, dronedarone appeared highly cost effective in each of the population groups examined compared with using standard baseline therapy alone as first-line treatment, or compared with sotalol or amiodarone as first-line AAD, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) well below \u00a320,000 per QALY gained. The ICER for dronedarone relative to class 1c agents was around \u00a319,000 per QALY. Although the evidence presented by the manufacturer indicated that dronedarone was cost effective, the estimates of treatment effect relative to other AADs and safety in the longer term were highly uncertain. The NICE Appraisal Committee in its preliminary guidance did not recommend the use of dronedarone for AF. However, following the response from a large number of consultees and commentators, NICE revised its preliminary guidance to allow the use of the drug in a specific subgroup of AF patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22136303/"}

Depression is very common in Parkinson's disease (PD), but its severity and particular symptoms vary. It can often be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms typically associated with depression (eg, sleep difficulties, fatigue) can be seen in nondepressed patients with PD, and signs thought to represent depression (eg, lack of facial expression, slowness) can be produced by PD itself. Apathy, although a possible feature of depression, can exist apart from depression and is often associated with cognitive impairment. Therefore, when evaluating patients with PD for possible depression, one should concentrate on the psychological or ideational aspects of the illness. One must determine whether the patient feels sad or hopeless or has a marked inability to enjoy life. Once it has been determined that the patient has clinically significant depressive symptoms, it is important to let him or her know that depression is an aspect of PD requiring treatment, just like the motor manifestations of the disease. The idea of adding antidepressant medications and the possibility of psychotherapy should be introduced. A very reasonable first-choice antidepressant is either sertraline or paroxetine . Because of isolated case reports of worsening motor function associated with institution of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), one should keep track of when the medication was started so that the patient can be seen again within a month. It is important from a psychological perspective to have regular follow-up visits when treating depression. If the SSRIs are ineffective or not tolerated, nortriptyline is a good next choice. It has fewer anticholinergic effects and is less likely to cause or worsen orthostatic hypotension than other tricyclic antidepressants. amitriptyline, although an old favorite of neurologists, is very sedating and has too much anticholinergic activity to be well tolerated in the higher doses needed to treat depression. If a patient could benefit from a dopamine agonist from a motor standpoint and his or her depressive symptoms are mild, consider using pramipexole, which may improve mood and motivation (although this has not yet been proven in a well-controlled trial). It is a good idea to keep patients on antidepressant therapy at least 6 months; many patients require long-term treatment. If a patient is severely depressed, he or she should be referred to a psychiatrist, who may consider admission to the hospital and possible electroconvulsive therapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11096753/"}

Further risk stratification is required to improve outcomes and reduce late effects. We evaluated clinical and biologic variables for patients with stage III FHWT without combined loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosomes 1p and 16q treated in the Children's Oncology Group protocol AREN0532. Methods From October 2006 to August 2013, 588 prospectively treated, centrally reviewed patients with stage III FHWT were treated with Regimen DD4A and radiation therapy. Tumor LOH at 1p and 16q was determined by microsatellite analysis. Ineligible patients (n = 5) and those with combined LOH 1p/16q (n = 40) were excluded. Results A total of 535 patients with stage III disease were studied. Median follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 0.2 to 9.5). Four-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival estimates were 88% (95% CI, 85% to 91%) and 97% (95% CI, 95% to 99%), respectively. A total of 58 of 66 relapses occurred in the first 2 years, predominantly pulmonary (n = 36). Eighteen patients died, 14 secondary to disease. A better EFS was associated with negative lymph node status ( P < .01) and absence of LOH 1p or 16q ( P < .01), but not with gross residual disease or peritoneal implants. In contrast, the 4-year EFS was only 74% in patients with combined positive lymph node status and LOH 1p or 16q. A total of 123 patients (23%) had delayed nephrectomy. Submitted delayed nephrectomy histology showed anaplasia (n = 8; excluded from survival analysis); low risk/completely necrotic (n = 7; zero relapses), intermediate risk (n = 63; six relapses), and high-risk/blastemal type (n=7; five relapses).

This study analyzed the safety and efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus chemotherapy as initial treatment for patients identified as local failures or not eligible for prostatectomy or radiation therapy due to advanced disease presentation. ### methods Enrolled patients received ADT in the form of leuprolide every 12 weeks for 24 months with bicalutamide initiating after the completion of chemotherapy . Chemotherapy consisted of ketoconazole and doxorubicin for weeks 1, 3, and 5 and estramustine and docetaxel and for weeks 2, 4 and 6. During weeks 7 and 8, no treatment was received. ### results Forty-six patients were enrolled, and forty-five patients were evaluable. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 23.4 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 53.7 months. Out of 45 patients with measurable disease, 22 patients had an objective response: 9 patients achieved a complete response; 2 patients achieved a partial response; 10 patients achieved stable disease. Frequent grade 3 adverse events included elevated ALT (17 %), hypokalemia (13 %), and hypophosphatemia (13 %). Grade 4 adverse events were rare and included low bicarbonate (2 %), hypokalemia (2 %), leukocytopenia (2 %), and neutropenia (2 %). ### conclusions The treatment demonstrated clinical benefit in all patient subsets with minimal reversible treatment-related adverse events. Subgroup analysis suggests that having prior local therapy resulted in greater PFS and OS.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23604530/"}

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic comparison of the inhaled corticosteroids. The inhaled corticosteroids contain physicochemical differences that alter both glucocorticoid receptor-binding characteristics and the pharmacokinetic variables of these drugs. Differences in receptor-binding affinity translate into differences in potency for different drugs. Differences in pharmacokinetics, however, determine the topical effect to systemic effect ratio, or the \"pulmonary targeting\" of the drug. Beneficial pharmacokinetic properties that may improve pulmonary targeting include low oral bioavailability, rapid systemic clearance, and slow absorption from the lung. Delivery devices can produce clinically significant differences in topical activity by altering the dose deposited in the lung and, for orally absorbed drugs, the amount deposited in the oropharynx and swallowed. Clinical trials have confirmed that differences in potency or drug delivery of 2-fold or more can be detected in patients with asthma. However, because of the relatively flat nature of the dose-response curve for morning peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in 1 second, the trials must be adequately powered and well controlled. The use of bronchial provocation measures are problematic because of the prolonged lag time for response. Study design flaws can lead to misinterpretation of results. Clinical studies have indicated the following relative potency differences : fluticasone propionate > budesonide = beclomethasone dipropionate > triamcinolone acetonide = flunisolide . Current evidence suggests that potency differences can be overcome by giving larger doses of the less potent drug.

The study of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is an emerging area of cancer research, in part due to their ability to serve as disease biomarkers. However, few studies have investigated lncRNAs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have identified one particular lncRNA, treRNA, which is overexpressed in CLL B-cells. We measured transcript expression in 144 CLL patient samples and separated samples into high or low expression of treRNA relative to the overall median. We found that high expression of treRNA is significantly associated with shorter time to treatment. High treRNA also correlates with poor prognostic indicators such as unmutated IGHV and high ZAP70 protein expression. We validated these initial findings in samples collected in a clinical trial comparing the nucleoside analog fludarabine alone or in combination with the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide in untreated CLL samples collected prior to starting therapy ( E2997 ) . High expression of treRNA was independently prognostic for shorter progression free survival in patients receiving fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. Given these results, in order to study the role of treRNA in DNA damage response we generated a model cell line system where treRNA was over-expressed in the human B-CLL cell line OSU-CLL. Relative to the vector control line, there was less cell death in OSU-CLL over-expressing treRNA after exposure to fludarabine and mafosfamide, due in part to a reduction in DNA damage.

Despite intensive research and widely publicized recommendations from consensus meetings in different continents, the public and primary care physicians are relatively slow in picking up the impact of Helicobacter pylori infection and identifying optimal therapies. The treatment of H. pylori infection has evolved from bismuth-containing regimens, 2-week proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-dual therapies, and now, the widely accepted PPI/ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) single week triple therapies. There is a wealth of evidence showing that these regimens are highly efficacious and well tolerated by patients. The MACH-2 studies have confirmed that the addition of a PPI to two antimicrobials has significantly improved the cure rate of H. pylori infection and reduced the impact of antimicrobial resistance. Attempts to use shorter regimens ranging from 1 to 3 days should be resisted because of their unacceptably low therapeutic efficacy. In the United States, there are some indications that 10-14 days of treatment may be required. While the first-line therapies for H. pylori infection is well established, we are still struggling with the choice of optimal regimen in retreatment after the first attempt fails. Quadruple therapy combining PPI with bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline has achieved a respectable success of around 85%. Switching between metronidazole and clarithromycin seems to be a sensible strategy as these two are the most effective anti-Helicobacter agents . Changing between PPI and RBC in the triple therapy would not make much difference without replacing some of the antimicrobials. rifabutin-containing regimens and high-dose PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy deserve more studies with large-scale studies. Data on anti-Helicobacter therapy for children are few. Most studies based on bismuth derivatives in combination with amoxicillin or tinidazole and were limited by the small number of cases. Recent studies showed 1-week bismuth-based triple therapy and 2-week PPI-based triple therapy are highly efficacious. Reinfection in children > 5 years of age after successful cure is rare.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an orphan malignancy that has attracted increasing attention during the last decade. Here we provide an update on advances in the field since our last review published in this journal in 2006. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and IGF-2 signaling have been confirmed as frequently altered signaling pathways in ACC, but recent data suggest that they are probably not sufficient for malignant transformation. Thus, major players in the pathogenesis are still unknown. For diagnostic workup, comprehensive hormonal assessment and detailed imaging are required because in most ACCs, evidence for autonomous steroid secretion can be found and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (if necessary, combined with functional imaging) can differentiate benign from malignant adrenocortical tumors. Surgery is potentially curative in localized tumors. Thus, we recommend a complete resection including lymphadenectomy by an expert surgeon. The pathology report should demonstrate the adrenocortical origin of the lesion (eg, by steroidogenic factor 1 staining) and provide Weiss score, resection status, and quantitation of the proliferation marker Ki67 to guide further treatment. Even after complete surgery, recurrence is frequent and adjuvant mitotane treatment improves outcome, but uncertainty exists as to whether all patients benefit from this therapy.

We therefore were able to assess the degree of non-cross-resistance between these two compounds. ### Patients And Methods Patients who had progressed after one platinum-based regimen were randomized to either topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)/d) x 5 every 21 days (n = 112) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) over 3 hours) every 21 days (n = 114).

Seven patients who responded to third-line topotecan and four patients who responded to paclitaxel had failed to respond to their second-line treatment. Median time to progression (from the start of third-line therapy) was 9 weeks in both groups, and median survival was 40 and 48 weeks for patients who were receiving topotecan or paclitaxel, respectively.

Drug combinations initially included 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and hydroxyurea, with the more recent addition of cisplatin; in the most recent trial, paclitaxel was substituted for cisplatin. The primary end point of these trials was definition of maximum tolerated doses in combination with radiation therapy.

In this study, we aimed to assess efficacy and safety after extended follow-up to inform the long-term clinical benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus sunitinib in this setting. ### methods In the phase 3, randomised, controlled CheckMate 214 trial, patients aged 18 years and older with previously untreated, advanced, or metastatic histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma with a clear-cell component were recruited from 175 hospitals and cancer centres in 28 countries. Patients were categorised by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk status into favourable-risk, intermediate-risk, and poor-risk subgroups and randomly assigned (1:1) to open-label nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously) every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) every 2 weeks; or sunitinib (50 mg orally) once daily for 4 weeks (6-week cycle).

Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with small interfering RNA targeting the alpha-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a key regulator of cellular adaptations to hypoxia, prevented hypoxia-induced resistance. HIF-1alpha small interfering RNA also selectively abolished the hypoxia-induced changes in the senescent population, indicating that the increased survival was due to protection against drug-induced senescence. These results support a requirement for HIF-1 in the adaptations leading to drug resistance and reveal that decreased drug-induced senescence is also an important contributor to the development of hypoxia-induced resistance.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18645006/"}

In Singapore, breast cancer is the leading female malignancy and its incidence has increased threefold over the past decades. For treatment of postmenopausal, hormone receptor positive early stage breast cancer, tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole are prescribed either as first-line therapy or sequentially. Currently, anastrozole is patented with a higher drug cost compared with tamoxifen. Hence , the aim of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of anastrozole versus tamoxifen in early stage breast cancer . ### methods A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed by using results from the Arimidex, tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial. Direct medical costs were estimated by billing data obtained via financial electronic databases. Utility scores were elicited from 20 experienced oncology nurses using the visual analogue scale. Cost per quality-adjusted life-years was calculated by using the societal perspective. A discount rate of 3% for both charges (expressed in 2010 Singapore dollars) and benefits was used. ### results At an additional cost of S $17,597, anastrozole treatment resulted in a gain of 0.085 life-year survival and 0.154 quality-adjusted life-year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of anastrozole was S $207,402 per life-year gained and S $114,061 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with tamoxifen. ### conclusion This is the first economic evaluation that used 10-year results from the Arimidex, tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial and utility elicited from the local population. If the World Health Organization's recommendation of 1 to 3 gross domestic product range is an acceptable threshold, anastrozole is deemed cost-effective compared with tamoxifen in the treatment of early stage breast cancer.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29702826/"}

A distinct population of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) is strongly associated with prior administration of topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors. These t-AMLs display distinct cytogenetic alterations, most often disrupting the MLL gene on chromosome 11q23 within a breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of 8.3 kb. We recently identified a unique site within the MLL bcr that is highly susceptible to DNA double-strand cleavage by classic topo II inhibitors ( e.g. , etoposide and doxorubicin ) . Here, we report that site-specific cleavage within the MLL bcr can be induced by either catalytic topo II inhibitors, genotoxic chemotherapeutic agents which do not target topo II, or nongenotoxic stimuli of apoptotic cell death, suggesting that this site-specific cleavage is part of a generalized cellular response to an apoptotic stimulus. We also show that site-specific cleavage within the MLL bcr can be linked to the higher-order chromatin fragmentation that occurs during the initial stages of apoptosis, possibly through cleavage of DNA loops at their anchorage sites to the nuclear matrix. In addition, we show that site-specific cleavage is conserved between species, as specific DNA cleavage can also be demonstrated within the murine MLL locus. Lastly, site-specific cleavage during apoptosis can also be identified at the AML1 locus, a locus which is also frequently involved in chromosomal rearrangements present in t-AML patients.

No patients developed chest pain, ST segment elevation, positive cardiac enzymes, or other evidence of abrupt vessel closure following the PTCA. All patients received intravenous heparin after PTCA and aspirin was begun on the day prior to PTCA . Patients were separated into two groups: those at hospital discharge incidentally treated for hypertension or heart failure with ACE inhibitors (n = 36), and those treated with a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors (n = 286). The two groups were similar with respect to age (61 +/- 13.5 vs. 60 +/- 12.5, p = NS) and other demographic characteristics. Restenosis, defined as the presentation to a physician with symptoms of angina within 6 months of the PTCA and the finding on repeat catheterization of a significant restenosis at the site of the PTCA, occurred in 30% of the patients who were discharged on a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors vs. 3% (p less than .05) in those treated with an ACE inhibitor.

The aim of the present study was to compare the behavioral profile of various SSRIs in alcohol-preferring cAA rats, a genetic model of alcoholism. The effects of acute IP administration of fluoxetine (doses in mg/kg 1-10), citalopram (3-30), fluvoxamine (3-30) and paroxetine (1-10) on ethanol (EtOH) intake and preference, as well as food and total fluid intake, were determined in a 12-h access, water vs. 10% v/v EtOH two-bottle choice paradigm.

The degree of selectivity, that is, the extent to which reductions in EtOH intake could be separated from reductions in food and/or total fluid intake varied across the compounds. Thus, whereas EtOH intake was more markedly affected than food intake by fluoxetine, both parameters were equally affected by citalopram, and food intake was more markedly affected than EtOH intake by fluvoxamine and paroxetine. The anti-alcohol effect also differed with respect to specificity, that is, the degree to which effects on EtOH intake coincided with effects on EtOH preference.

The observed variation in the degree of selectivity and specificity of the anti-alcohol effect of SSRIs suggests that reductions in EtOH intake are not merely a consequence of a general suppressive effect on consummatory behavior.

In a series of trials that began in 1992, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) investigated the role of paclitaxel in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer. The design of the first trial, a limited-institution pilot study, involved alternating doxorubicin and paclitaxel as single agents. The alternating schedule was well tolerated and associated with objective responses in seven of 12 patients entered into the trial. In the second trial, a limited-institution phase I trial, bolus doxorubicin was combined with paclitaxel administered over a 24-hour infusion, with administration of the two drugs separated by 4 hours. While no dose-limiting toxicity was seen at doses of 50 and 150 mg/m2 of doxorubicin and paclitaxel, respectively, dose-limiting mucositis occurred at respective doses of 60 and 175 mg/m2. Mucositis was more common when administration of paclitaxel preceded that of doxorubicin than when doxorubicin preceded paclitaxel.

The nocturnal decreases in systolic and diastolic BP were both greater with losartan treatment than with quinapril treatment (systolic BP: 6.1% +/- 5.9% v 2.5% +/- 6.9%, diastolic BP: 6.4% +/- 6.5% v 3.3% +/- 7.8%, both P <.05). The nocturnal decrease in urinary norepinephrine excretion was greater with losartan treatment than with quinapril treatment (52.8% +/- 9.7% v 42.8% +/- 17.2%, P <.05). ### conclusions losartan enhances the nocturnal decrease in ambulatory BP compared with that of quinapril in patients with a previous history of stroke presumably by way of the suppression of nocturnal sympathetic nervous activity.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12441222/"}

Interventional pain management is a specialty that utilizes invasive procedures to diagnose and treat chronic pain. Patients undergoing these treatments may be receiving exogenous anticoagulants and antithrombotics. Even though the risk of major bleeding is very small, the consequences can be catastrophic. However, the role of antithrombotic therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease to decrease the incidence of acute cerebral and cardiovascular events is also crucial. Overall, there is a paucity of literature on the subject of bleeding risk in interventional pain management along with practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and anti-thrombotic therapy. ### Study Design Best evidence synthesis. ### objective To critically appraise and synthesize the literature with assessment of the bleeding risk of interventional techniques including practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy. ### methods The available literature on the bleeding risk of interventional techniques and practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy was reviewed. Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 through December 2012 and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles. ### results There is good evidence for the risk of thromboembolic phenomenon in patients who discontinue antithrombotic therapy, spontaneous epidural hematomas occur with or without traumatic injury in patients with or without anticoagulant therapy associated with stressors such as chiropractic manipulation, diving, and anatomic abnormalities such as ankylosing spondylitis, and the lack of necessity of discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including low dose aspirin prior to performing interventional techniques. There is fair evidence that excessive bleeding, including epidural hematoma formation may occur with interventional techniques when antithrombotic therapy is continued, the risk of thromboembolic phenomenon is higher than the risk of epidural hematomas with discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy prior to interventional techniques, to continue phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole [Persantine], cilostazol [Pletal], and Aggrenox [aspirin and dipyridamole]), and that anatomic conditions such as spondylosis, ankylosing spondylitis and spinal stenosis, and procedures involving the cervical spine; multiple attempts; and large bore needles increase the risk of epidural hematoma; and rapid assessment and surgical or nonsurgical intervention to manage patients with epidural hematoma can avoid permanent neurological complications. There is limited evidence to discontinue antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas and/or to continue antiplatelet therapy clopidogrel (Plavix), ticlopidine (Ticlid), or prasugrel (Effient) during interventional techniques to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic fatalities. There is limited evidence in reference to newer antithrombotic agents dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) to discontinue to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas during interventional techniques and to continue to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic events. ### recommendations The recommendations derived from the comprehensive assessment of the literature and guidelines are to continue NSAIDs and low dose aspirin , and phosphodiesterase inhibitors ( dipyridamole , cilostazol , Aggrenox ) during interventional techniques . However, the recommendations for discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel) is variable with clinical judgment to continue or discontinue based on the patient's condition, the planned procedure, risk factors, and desires, and the cardiologist's opinion. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin may be discontinued 12 hours prior to performing interventional techniques. warfarin should be discontinued or international normalized ratio (INR) be normalized to 1.4 or less for high risk procedures and 2 or less for low risk procedures based on risk factors. It is also recommended to discontinue Pradaxa for 24 hours for paravertebral interventional techniques in 2 to 4 days for epidural interventions in patients with normal renal function and for longer periods of time in patients with renal impairment, and to discontinue rivaroxaban for 24 hours prior to performing interventional techniques. ### limitations The paucity of the literature. ### conclusion Based on the available literature including guidelines, the recommendations in patients with antithrombotic therapy for therapy prior to interventional techniques are provided.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23615893/"}

This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00480363. ### findings Between Nov 8, 2007, and June 9, 2010, 125 patients were enrolled and underwent randomisation. 119 patients comprised the per-protocol population and were randomly assigned to receive either lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (n=57) or observation (n=62). The cutoff date for this update was June 30, 2015. Median follow-up for surviving patients was 75 months (IQR 67-85). lenalidomide plus dexamethasone continued to provide a benefit on time to progression compared with observation (median time to progression not reached [95% CI 47 months-not reached] vs 23 months [16-31]; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b724 [95% CI 0\u00b714-0\u00b741]; p<0\u00b70001). Progression to multiple myeloma occurred in 53 (86%) of 62 patients in the observation group compared with 22 (39%) of 57 patients in the treatment group. At data cutoff, ten (18%) patients had died in the treatment group and 22 (36%) patients had died in the observation group; median overall survival from the time of study entry had not been reached in either group (95% CI 65 months-not reached vs 53 months-not reached; HR 0\u00b743 [95% CI 0\u00b721-0\u00b792], p=0\u00b7024). Survival in patients who had received subsequent treatments at the time of progression to active disease did not differ between groups (HR 1\u00b734 [95% CI 0\u00b754-3\u00b730]; p=0\u00b750). The most frequently reported grade 3 adverse events in patients given lenalidomide plus dexamethasone were infection (four [6%]), asthenia (four [6%]), neutropenia (three [5%]), and skin rash (two [3%]); these events all occurred during induction therapy. No grade 4 adverse events occurred, but one (2%) patient in the lenalidomide plus dexamethasone group died from a respiratory infection during induction therapy The frequency of second primary malignancies was higher in patients in the treatment group than in those in the observation group (six [10%] of 62 patients vs one [2%] of 63 patients), but the cumulative risk of development did not differ significantly between the groups (p=0\u00b7070). ### interpretation This study is, to our knowledge, the first randomised trial in which early treatment has been assessed in selected patients with high-risk smouldering multiple myeloma. Positive results from ongoing trials would support the use of early treatment for patients with high-risk disease in the near future. ### funding Pethema (Spanish Program for the Treatment of Hematologic Diseases).", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27402145/"}

Based on prior reports suggesting a positive correlation between fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and total sperm count and concentration, we sought to identify changes in testicular FDG uptake over the course of chemotherapy in young men with Hodgkin's lymphoma. ### methods Fifty-two patients with a mean age of 24.2 years (range 15.5-44.4) at diagnosis monitored with FDG PET/CT to assess treatment response for Hodgkin's lymphoma were selected for this retrospective analysis under an Institutional Review Board waiver. Of the patients , 26 were treated with a chemotherapy regimen known to cause prolonged and sometimes permanent azoospermia ( BEACOPP -- bleomycin , etoposide , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , vincristine , procarbazine , and prednisolone ) and 26 with a regimen known to have a much milder effect on gonadal function ( ABVD -- doxorubicin , bleomycin , vincristine , and dacarbazine ) . Each patient underwent one FDG PET/CT before treatment and at least one FDG PET/CT after start of chemotherapy. In all examinations, FDG activity was measured in the testes with different quantification metrics: maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), SUVmean, functional volume (FV) and total testicular glycolysis (TTG), and blood pool activity determined (SUVmean). ### results Testicular FDG uptake (SUVmax) was significantly associated with blood pool activity (p < 0.001). Furthermore, testicular FDG uptake metrics incorporating volume (e.g., FV and TTG) were associated with age. There was no significant change in SUVmax, SUVmean, FV, and TTG from the PET/CT at baseline to the PET/CTs over the course of chemotherapy either for patients treated with BEACOPP or for patients treated with ABVD. ### conclusion For patients undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma, there is a significant association between testicular FDG uptake and blood pool activity, but no significant changes in FDG uptake over the course of chemotherapy. Therefore, FDG uptake may not be a feasible surrogate marker for fertility monitoring in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23389428/"}

The effect of dasatinib , an inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases , on paclitaxel sensitivity was measured in ovarian cancer cells and HEY xenografts . The roles of p27(Kip1), Bcl-2, and Cdk1 in apoptosis induced by dasatinib and paclitaxel were assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, siRNA knockdown of gene expression, transfection with Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression vectors, and flow cytometry. All statistical tests were two-sided. ### results Src family and Abl kinases were identified as modulators of paclitaxel sensitivity in SKOv3 cells. The siRNA knockdown of Src, Fyn, or Abl1 enhanced paclitaxel-mediated growth inhibition in ovarian cancer cells compared with a control siRNA. HEY cells treated with dasatinib plus paclitaxel formed fewer colonies than did cells treated with either agent alone.

Metastatic sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma (sRCC) is an aggressive variant of RCC with generally poor prognosis. Treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors or chemotherapy generates only short-lived responses. Recent research has suggested a role for combination checkpoint inhibition as first line treatment for metastatic sRCC. This therapy consists of induction with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitor, ipilimumab, administered with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab. After completion of four cycles of combination therapy, single-agent maintenance nivolumab is recommended until progression. Patients who progress on maintenance nivolumab are switched to alternate therapy. Herein, we present a case of a patient with RCC who progressed on maintenance nivolumab who, on retreatment with ipilimumab, demonstrated a significant response In addition, we summarize important findings to support the role of salvage ipilimumab in patients with sRCC. ### Case Presentation A 46-year-old man presented with flank pain and hematuria, the work up of which noted a left kidney mass for which he underwent nephrectomy and was diagnosed with localized sRCC with 60% sarcomatoid differentiation. Within 3 months of nephrectomy, he presented with recurrent flank pain and was diagnosed with recurrence of disease. He was treated with ipilimumab 1\u2009mg/kg and nivolumab 3\u2009mg/kg for four doses and demonstrated a partial response. He was then transitioned to single agent nivolumab maintenance. After 3\u2009months on maintenance therapy, he was noted to have progression of disease. Given prior response to immune check point combination, it was decided to rechallenge the patient with 1\u2009mg/kg ipilimumab. After two doses of ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy, the patient was noted to have a partial response. He maintained a response for an additional 9 months and treatment was eventually discontinued due to grade 3 toxicity and progression. ### conclusions This case report demonstrates the utility of retreatment with ipilimumab as a salvage option for patients progressing on maintenance PD-1 inhibitors in metastatic RCC. Further studies are needed to identify predictors of response and toxicity to this approach , as well as the optimal scheduling of ipilimumab with maintenance nivolumab .", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32114501/"}

The present study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of palbociclib plus fulvestrant in Japanese patients enrolled in PALOMA-3. ### methods Pre/peri/postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- MBC were randomized 2:1 to fulvestrant ( 500 mg ) and either palbociclib ( 125 mg/day ; 3 weeks on/1 week off ; n = 347 ) or placebo ( n = 174 ) . Prespecified exploratory analyses compared the efficacy ( data cutoff : October 23 , 2015 ) , safety , and pharmacokinetics ( data cutoff : December 5 , 2014 ) in Japanese women versus the overall population . ### results A total of 35 Japanese women were randomized to palbociclib-fulvestrant (n\u2009=\u200927) or placebo-fulvestrant (n\u2009=\u20098). Median progression-free survival was 13.6\u00a0months (95% CI, 7.5-not estimable) in the Japanese palbociclib-fulvestrant group and 11.2\u00a0months (95% CI, 5.6-not estimable) in the placebo-fulvestrant group. The most common adverse event (AE) in Japanese patients was neutropenia (all grades, 93%); no discontinuations were due to an AE. Geometric mean trough concentration values (within-subject mean steady state) for palbociclib were similar for Japanese Asian (excluding Japanese), and non-Asian patients (84.4\u00a0ng/mL, 86.3\u00a0ng/mL, and 74.8\u00a0ng/mL, respectively). ### Conclusion S The results for the overall population and Japanese patients in PALOMA-3 suggest that palbociclib plus fulvestrant was effective and well tolerated in Japanese patients with HR+/HER2\u2012 MBC whose disease had progressed on prior endocrine therapy (Pfizer; NCT01942135).", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30392115/"}

These AEDs do not appear to have a common mechanism of action in that both inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; e.g., clobazam, clonazepam, and valproate) and excitatory glutamate (e.g., lamotrigine and topiramate) mechanisms are involved. Ethosuximide primarily acts by blocking T-type voltage-gated calcium channels in thalamic neurones while topiramate and zonisamide have multiple mechanisms of action . In contrast, levetiracetam is unique in that it may act via a specific binding site in the brain. In terms of their pharmacokinetic characteristics, all eight AEDs are rapidly absorbed after oral ingestion with peak blood concentration being achieved within 1-4 hours. Bioavailability is 100% with the exception clonazepam (90%) and topiramate (81-95%). Plasma protein binding is variable with valproate (90%), clobazam (85%) and clonazepam (86%) showing substantial binding, lamotrigine (55%) and zonisamide (50%) intermediate binding, and levetiracetam (0%), ethosuximide (0%) and topiramate (10%) being minimally bound. However, the binding by zonisamide is complicated by its binding to erythrocytes as well as albumin. All AEDs, with the exception of lamotrigine and levetiracetam, undergo elimination as a result of extensive metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are highly amenable to induction and inhibition by other drugs and therefore susceptible to pharmacokinetic interactions. lamotrigine metabolism is via hepatic glucuronidation, a process that is also susceptible to induction and inhibition by concurrent drugs. levetiracetam is minimally metabolized (by hydrolysis in blood), is excreted predominantly unchanged in urine, and to date has not been associated with any clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions. Using a semiquantitative pharmacokinetic rating system, based on 16 pharmacokinetic characteristics, a direct comparison between AEDs is possible. Thus valproic acid, regarded as the drug of first choice in the treatment of IGEs, rates lowest with respect to favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics, mostly because of its nonlinear pharmacokinetics, extensive hepatic metabolism, and its high propensity to interact both with other AEDs and non-AEDs. levetiracetam rates highest with topiramate in second place.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16302888/"}

Therefore , if a combination regimen is necessary to control CMV in a patient , foscarnet and ganciclovir should be used first . There are several advantages of the combination therapy regimen. For instance, lower doses of the individual agents can be used with superior efficacy to monotherapy and similar toxicities. Also, for neurologic CMV involvement, the combination therapy may be superior to monotherapy because of the variable CSF penetration of either drug alone. In addition, combined therapy may be beneficial in treating and/or preventing drug-resistant strains of CMV. Even though combination therapy has evidence of superior efficacy compared with monotherapy in the treatment of CMV, several issues must be considered. First, combination therapy has longer administration times because of the infusion of multiple drugs, which may be an inconvenience. Also, even though the toxic effects are similar with both combined therapy and monotherapy, the adverse effects associated with combination therapy may be less well tolerated and may negatively affect the patient's quality of life.

The safety and efficacy of RPIID dose was evaluated in phase II stage. ### results In total, 50 patients were enrolled (13 to phase Ib and 37 to phase II). In the first dose-finding cohort (afatinib 40 mg plus nimotuzumab 100 mg), one patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 3 diarrhea and in the subsequent cohort (afatinib 40 mg plus nimotuzumab 200 mg), two DLTs (grade 3 diarrhea and grade 3 neutropenia) occurred in 2 of 6 patients. Accordingly, RPIID was determined as afatinib 40 mg plus nimotuzumab 100 mg. In 44 patients treated with RPIID, 7 (16%) patients had grade 3 toxicities; skin rash (7%), diarrhea (5%), acne (2%), and fatigue (2%). The overall response rate was 23% and the median duration of response was 4.3 months (range, 0.7-16.2 months).

Until recently, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the only available oral anticoagulants evaluated for long-term treatment of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), particularly after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Despite efficacy in this setting, VKAs are rarely used because they are cumbersome to administer. Instead, the more readily manageable antiplatelet agents are the mainstay of prevention in ACS patients. This situation has the potential to change with the introduction of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which are easier to administer than VKAs because they can be given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. The NOACs include dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin, and apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban, which inhibit factor Xa. Apixaban and rivaroxaban were evaluated in phase III trials for prevention of recurrent ischaemia in ACS patients , most of whom were also receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel . Although at the doses tested rivaroxaban was effective and apixaban was not, both agents increased major bleeding. The role for the NOACs in ACS management, although promising, is therefore complicated, because it is uncertain how they compare with newer antiplatelet agents, such as prasugrel, ticagrelor or vorapaxar, and because their safety in combination with these other drugs is unknown. Ongoing studies are also now evaluating the use of NOACs in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients, where their role is established, with coexistent ACS or coronary stenting. Focusing on CHD, we review the results of clinical trials with the NOACs and provide a perspective on their future incorporation into clinical practice.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26952877/"}

Electrical and mechanical stimuli were used to test nociceptive threshold of the limb before and after IVRLP/perineural anaesthesia. For lidocaine and mepivacaine trials, blood was collected from the jugular vein and synovial fluid from the radiocarpal joint before, during and out to 24\u00a0hours after IVRLP. Drug concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. ### results Nociceptive thresholds for lidocaine, mepivacaine and perineural anaesthesia trials were significantly increased compared with saline and baseline values at 10, 20 and 30\u00a0minutes, with no differences between anaesthetic trials. During this time, horses had lower heart rates than IVRLP with saline. After tourniquet release at 30\u00a0minutes, nociceptive thresholds for lidocaine and mepivacaine trials gradually returned to baselines, whereas perineural anaesthesia trial remained unchanged out to an hour.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable despite the introduction of new treatments. CLL B cells are characterized by an apoptosis defect rather than excessive proliferation, but proliferation centers have been found in organs such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes. In this study, we analyzed gene expression modifications in CLL B cells after treatment with valproic acid (VPA), a well-tolerated anti-epileptic drug with HDAC inhibitory activity. CLL B cells obtained from 14 patients were treated in vitro with a concentration of 1 mM VPA for 4 h. VPA effects on gene expression were thereafter studied using Affymetrix technology, and some identified genes were validated by real-time PCR and western blot. We observed that VPA induced apoptosis by downregulating several anti-apoptotic genes and by upregulating pro-apoptotic genes. Furthermore , VPA significantly increased chemosensitivity to fludarabine , flavopiridol , bortezomib , thalidomide and lenalidomide . VPA inhibited the proliferation of CpG/IL2-stimulated CLL B cells and modulated many cell cycle messenger RNAs. In conclusion, exposure of CLL B cells to VPA induced apoptosis, potentiated chemotherapeutic agent effects and inhibited proliferation. These data strongly suggest the use of VPA in CLL treatment, particularly in combination with antileukemia agents.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19710697/"}

A previous study showed that flavopiridol increased doxorubicin sensitivity in hypoxic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by increasing apoptosis through suppressing hypoxia-inducible N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG1) expression. However, this has not been investigated in an in vivo HCC model. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate whether the combination of doxorubicin and flavopiridol has a synergistic anti-tumor effect in an in vivo HCC model. ### methods An HCC mouse model was established by implanting C3H/He mouse with MH134 cells. Then , doxorubicin with or without flavopiridol was injected . The anti-tumor efficacy was assessed by evaluating tumor volumes, and the underlying mechanism was investigated by quantifying apoptotic cells, the Ki-67 proliferation index, and microvessel densities (MVDs). Immunohistochemistry of NDRG1 was performed to determine the underlying mechanism. ### results Tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the doxorubicin\u00a0+\u00a0flavopiridol combination group compared to the other three groups. The percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher, and Ki-67-positive proliferating cells were significantly lower in the combination group compared to the other groups; however, MVDs were not significantly different across the groups. Increased apoptosis by flavopiridol occurred by suppressing hypoxia-inducible NDRG1 expression. ### conclusions These results show that a combination of doxorubicin and flavopiridol has a synergistic anti-tumor effect in an in vivo HCC model. This synergistic effect of combination therapy was attributed to increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation of tumor cells rather than decreased angiogenesis. These findings suggest that flavopiridol might be an effective adjuvant therapy to doxorubicin-resistant HCC cells by inducing apoptosis through suppression of NDRG1 expression.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25989942/"}

The purpose of the study was to assess treatment response and overall outcome in a cohort of patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma and to compare the results with those for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated in a similar manner. We retrospectively analyzed data of 40 consecutive adult patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma referred to our institution for consideration of second-line chemotherapy aiming for autologous stem cell transplant between January 1999 and December 2006. A cohort of 126 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma managed similarly served as a comparison group.

A prospective Children's Cancer Group study, CCG-3881, has been completed to determine if a more accurate prediction of prognosis by biologic features can identify subgroups of infants with stage IV neuroblastoma (NBL) who require differing intensities of treatment. ### Patients And Methods One hundred thirty-four infants were registered from June 1989 to August 1995, with a median follow-up of 47.1 months (range, 0 to 88 months). The biologic factors examined were tumor MYCN copy number, Shimada histopathologic classification, serum ferritin, and bone marrow immunocytology (sensitivity, one tumor cell per 10(5) bone marrow cells). Patients treated on CCG-3881 ( n = 116 ) received four-drug chemotherapy for 9 months ( cisplatin , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , and etoposide ) , with surgery and local radiation to residual disease . After January 1991, all subsequent infants with tumor MYCN amplification (n = 18) were transferred after one cycle of therapy to the high-risk CCG-3891 protocol (open January 1991 to April 1996) for more intensive treatment. ### results The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (mean +/- SD) for the 134 infants were 63% +/- 5% and 71% +/- 5%, respectively. Patients whose tumors were without MYCN amplification had a 93% +/- 4% 3-year EFS, whereas those with amplified MYCN had a 10% +/- 7% 3-year EFS (P <. 0001). Each of the other biologic features studied had prognostic significance in univariate analysis but not after stratifying by MYCN copy number. ### conclusion Infants less than 1 year of age at diagnosis with stage IV NBL have a much improved outcome compared with children >/= 1 year of age. Nonamplified MYCN tumors identify a group of infants with a 93% +/- 4% EFS, whereas amplified MYCN copy number clearly identifies patients who are unlikely to survive despite intensive chemotherapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10715296/"}

Previous single-dose crossover studies have established therapeutic equivalence of formoterol when administered at the same nominal dose via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or pressurized hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) metered-dose inhaler (pMDI). Demonstration of equivalent bronchodilation for formoterol administered as formoterol DPI or combined with budesonide in one pMDI (budesonide/formoterol pMDI) would indicate that the greater clinical efficacy of the budesonide/formoterol pMDI combination is due to the budesonide contribution and not to differences in formoterol formulation or delivery device. ### objective To determine whether the formoterol-related bronchodilatory effects of formoterol DPI and budesonide/formoterol pMDI are similar, despite formoterol formulation and delivery device differences. ### methods This was a multicenter, open-label, five-period crossover study conducted in 201 adult patients with stable asthma. The study included a screening visit, a 7- to 14-day run-in period, during which patients were treated with budesonide pMDI (80 microg per inhalation, two inhalations twice daily), and a randomized treatment period that included five single-day treatment periods, during which patients received single-dose crossover treatments, each of which was separated by a 3- to 14-day washout period. Patients were randomized to five of seven single-dose treatments (one, two, or four inhalations of budesonide/formoterol pMDI 80/4.5 microg; four inhalations of budesonide pMDI 80 microg plus one, two, or four inhalations of formoterol DPI 4.5 microg; or four inhalations of budesonide pMDI 80 microg alone). At clinic visits, the budesonide pMDI dose was coordinated with the budesonide dose delivered via the budesonide/formoterol pMDI such that all patients received a 320-microg dose of budesonide. The primary variable was average forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from the area under the curve divided by time from 12-h serial spirometry. ### results Average 12-h FEV1 values were similar, regardless of delivery device, among treatments with the same nominal formoterol doses and dose-ordered within each device; mean FEV1 values were significantly higher for treatments containing formoterol versus budesonide alone. The formoterol dose potency ratio for budesonide/formoterol pMDI:formoterol DPI (0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-1.27) demonstrated clinical equivalence in bronchodilation at the same formoterol dose. ### conclusion Budesonide/formoterol pMDI affords equivalent formoterol-related bronchodilatory effects versus formoterol DPI at formoterol doses of 4.5 , 9 , and 18 microg , indicating that practitioners can expect and patients will experience similar bronchodilation from the same dose of formoterol whether it is delivered as monotherapy via a DPI or as combination therapy with budesonide via one pMDI .", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17625985/"}

The standard treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is combination of 5- fluorouracil/folinic acid with irinotecan or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in 70%-80% of colorectal cancers (CRC). EGFR overexpression is known to be involved in carcinogenic processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis. Monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR have shown antitumor activity and improved the efficacy of chemotherapy. cetuximab is a chimeric immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (MoAb). Several clinical studies have shown cetuximab, either as a single agent or in combination with irinotecan, having promising efficacy in patients with metastatic CRC. cetuximab with 5-fluorouracil/LV (leucovorin) plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy has shown higher response rate and longer time to progression as first-line treatment of mCRC. Currently, there are no data showing that addition of cetuximab would prolong overall survival in randomized studies. panitumumab, a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, has also shown antitumor activity against EGFR-expressing mCRC with less allergic reaction. Anti-EGFR MoAbs are well tolerated and have limited overlapping toxicities in combination with other cytotoxic drugs.

This last effect was not due to sodium inactivation. Cortically evoked EPSP-IPSP sequences were inhibited during the depolarizations.

These effects were blocked by fluphenazine, relatively selective blocker of the DA-sensitive adenylate cyclase.

Outcome measures were: numbers of swollen and tender joints, duration of morning stiffness, visual analog scale (VAS) for articular pain, physician global assessment index, patient global assessment index, SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), disappearance of skin rash and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). ### results Forty-one patients consented to participate, 15 were allocated in the MTX group and 26 in the CQ group. Two patients on MTX dropped out due to side-effects and two in the CQ group, one due to side-effects and one due to inefficacy. Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters of the two groups were nearly identical. In both groups the clinical and laboratory parameters improved significantly over 24 weeks, except the ESR in the MTX group.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive tumors with dismal survival and a high death rate due to chemotherapeutic failure. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays a pivotal role in PC response to gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is a P-gp inhibitor.

Flow cytometric analysis was used for the determination of cell cycle, apoptosis, and stemness markers in PC cells. Besides, immunoblotting was used for assessment of Bax, caspase 3, cyclin D1, and P-gp expressions. ### Key Findings diltiazem co-treatment, either with gemcitabine or 5-FU, synergistically reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis, and caused cell cycle arrest. In addition, diltiazem co-treatment decreased the expressions of stem cell markers CD24 and CD44, increased the expressions of Bax and cleaved caspase 3, enhanced DNA fragmentation, and attenuated cyclin D1 and P-gp expressions as compared to cells treated with either gemcitabine or 5-FU alone. ### significance Our findings suggest that diltiazem may be potential neoadjuvant therapy to enhance the response of PC to gemcitabine or 5-FU treatment.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33011221/"}

The LNCaP-R273H model is an LNCaP variant expressing a p53(GOF) allele; like CWR22Rv1 and PC-3, it is able to grow in a minimal androgen environment. The effects of GCP treatment in combination with the aforementioned drugs were measured using an MTT assay, Western blotting, flow cytometric analysis, and caspase activation assay. Altered schedules of drug administration were explored using combinations of GCP and docetaxel. ### results GCP potentiated the activity of docetaxel in all four cell lines, resulting in growth inhibition and increased apoptosis. The combination of GCP and bicalutamide had enhanced activity in both the LNCaP and LNCaP-R273H lines, which may better represent patient tumour cells after progression to androgen independence. Administration of docetaxel followed by GCP resulted in a synergistic interaction in LNCaP cells, with increased apoptosis.

Costs were estimated through resource-use data taken from the published trials and the unpublished sponsor submissions. Unit costs were taken from published sources, where available. An economic evaluation was undertaken to compare the cost-effectiveness of capecitabine and UFT/LV with three intravenous 5-FU/LV regimens widely used in the UK: the Mayo, the modified de Gramont regimen and the inpatient de Gramont regimens. ### results The evidence suggests that treatment with capecitabine improves overall response rates and has an improved adverse effect profile in comparison with 5-FU/LV treatment with the Mayo regimen, with the exception of hand-foot syndrome. Time to disease progression or death after treatment with UFT/LV in one study appears to be shorter than after treatment with 5-FU/LV with the Mayo regimen, although it also had an improved adverse effect profile. Neither capecitabine nor UFT/LV appeared to improve health-related quality of life. Little information on patient preference was available for UFT/LV, but there was indicated a strong preference for this over 5-FU/LV. The total cost of capecitabine and UFT/LV treatments were estimated at 2111 pounds and 3375 pounds, respectively, compared with the total treatment cost for the Mayo regimen of 3579 pounds. Cost estimates were also presented for the modified de Gramont and inpatient de Gramont regimens. These were 3684 pounds and 6155 pounds, respectively. No survival advantage was shown in the RCTs of the oral drugs against the Mayo regimen. Cost savings of capecitabine and UFT/LV over the Mayo regimen were estimated to be 1461 pounds and 209 pounds, respectively. Drug acquisition costs were higher for the oral therapies than for the Mayo regimen, but were offset by lower administration costs. Adverse event treatment costs were similar across the three regimens. It was inferred that there was no survival difference between the oral drugs and the de Gramont regimens. Cost savings of capecitabine and UFT/LV over the modified de Gramont regimen were estimated to be 1353 pounds and 101 pounds, respectively, and over the inpatient de Gramont regimen were estimated to be 4123 pounds and 2870 pounds, respectively. ### conclusions The results show that there are cost savings associated with the use of oral therapies. No survival difference has been proven between the oral drugs and the Mayo regimen. In addition, no evidence of a survival difference between the Mayo regimen and the de Gramont regimens has been identified. However, improved progression-free survival and an improved adverse event profile have been shown for the de Gramont regimen over the Mayo regimen. Further research is recommended into the following areas: quality of life data should be included in trials of colorectal cancer treatments; the place of effective oral treatments in the treatment of colorectal cancer, the safety mechanisms needed to ensure compliance and the monitoring of adverse effects; the optimum duration of treatment; the measurement of patient preference; and a phase III comparative trial of capecitabine and UFT/LV versus modified de Gramont treatment to determine whether there was any survival advantage and to collate the necessary economic data.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14604497/"}

The clinical effectiveness evidence for both cetuximab and panitumumab was taken from a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) in each case and for cetuximab plus irinotecan from several sources. ### results Patients are predicted to survive for approximately 6 months on BSC, 8.5 months on panitumumab, 10 months on cetuximab, and 16.5 months on cetuximab plus irinotecan. panitumumab is dominated, and cetuximab is extended dominated. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a395,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was estimated for cetuximab versus BSC and is likely to be relatively accurate, because the relevant clinical evidence is taken from a high-quality RCT.

Consolidation radiotherapy was administered to regions with initial bulky disease or residual tumor after chemotherapy. ### results All patients were assessable for toxicity and treatment outcome. Eighty-six patients received the planned eight cycles of BEACOPP-14. Consolidation radiotherapy was given in 66 patients. Chemotherapy could generally be administered on schedule. Dose reductions varied among drugs but were generally low. Acute toxicity was moderate, with World Health Organization grade 3/4 leukopenia in 75%, thrombocytopenia in 23%, anemia in 65%, and infection in 12% of patients. A total of 88 patients (94%) achieved a complete remission. Four patients had progressive disease.

We report the results of replacement of steroids by azathioprine ( AZA ) in 25 primary cadaveric renal transplant recipients initially treated with CsA and methylprednisolone ( MP ) . MP taper was started 8.8 +/- 5.6 months posttransplant when the MP dose was either 10 mg/day or 20 mg every other day. MP was tapered off over a 5-month period. At the initiation of MP taper, AZA was added at 1 mg/kg/day and increased to 1.5 mg/kg/day after two months. The CsA dose was adjusted to maintain trough serum levels as measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) of 50-75 ng/ml, during and after MP withdrawal. Seventeen patients have remained continuously off MP for 14.6 +/- 5.0 months with stable renal function. Reinstitution of MP at 10 mg/day was required in 8 patients, 6 for rejection (1.8 +/- 0.7 months after MP withdrawal), 1 for AZA-induced leukopenia, and 1 for de novo glomerulopathy. Renal function returned to baseline in all 6 patients with rejection after reinstitution of MP. Two of these patients have again been successfully retapered off MP. In the patients withdrawn from MP, body weight and mean arterial blood pressure had decreased by 2.1 +/- 1.3 kg (P less than .05) and 11 +/- 7 mmHg (P less than .05), respectively, at the time of the most recent follow-up compared with values at the initiation of steroid withdrawal. The number of blood pressure medications per patient decreased by 38% (P less than .05) and 6 patients were able to discontinue all antihypertensive drugs after cessation of steroids. Discontinuation of MP also resulted in a decrease in serum cholesterol concentration from 248 +/- 50 to 217 +/- 55 mg/dl (P less than .05). We conclude that steroids can be replaced by AZA in the majority of CsA-treated primary cadaveric renal transplant recipients by the end of the first posttransplant year without an adverse effect on graft survival.

Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in the western world, and although fluorouracil (5-FU) has been used in its treatment for almost 40 years, new agents with significant activity have been introduced recently. irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar), a topoisomerase I inhibitor, administered at 300 to 350 mg/m2 every 3 weeks is significantly more active than continuous-infusion 5-FU in patients who have experienced disease progression after conventional therapy with 5-FU. In comparison to best supportive care, irinotecan improves survival and preserves quality of life despite treatment-related toxicity. Moreover, the combination of irinotecan and 5-FU has been explored in a number of different schedules. In previously untreated patients, overall response rates are high. irinotecan can also be combined with mitomycin (mitomycin-C [Mutamycin]), oxaliplatin, or raltitrexed (Tomudex). oxaliplatin is a new-generation platinum compound that has demonstrated activity against colorectal carcinoma in preclinical trials. It has been evaluated as a single agent against advanced colorectal carcinoma in the salvage setting and also in combination with 5-FU as initial therapy for metastatic disease (where it shows significant activity). The toxicity profile of oxaliplatin (chiefly characterized by neurotoxicity) differs from that of irinotecan (primarily producing diarrhea) and the potential, therefore, exists for combining these agents or for exploiting their possible synergy with 5-FU.

The randomised phase 3 TURANDOT trial compared two approved bevacizumab-containing regimens for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in terms of efficacy, safety, and quality of life. The interim analysis did not confirm non-inferior overall survival (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b704; 97\u00b75% repeated CI [RCI] -\u221e to 1\u00b769). Here we report final results of our study aiming to show non-inferior overall survival with first-line bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. ### methods In this multinational, open-label, randomised phase 3 TURANDOT trial, patients aged 18 years or older who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2 and measurable or non-measurable HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had received no previous chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were stratified and randomly assigned (1:1) using permuted blocks of size six to either bevacizumab plus paclitaxel (bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks) or bevacizumab plus capecitabine (bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on day 1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 every 3 weeks) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Stratification factors were oestrogen or progesterone receptor status, country, and menopausal status. The primary objective was to show non-inferior overall survival with bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel in the per-protocol population by rejecting the null hypothesis of inferiority (HR \u22651\u00b733) using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00600340. ### findings Between Sept 10, 2008, and Aug 30, 2010, 564 patients were randomised, representing the intent-to-treat population. The per-protocol population comprised 531 patients (266 in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group and 265 in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group). At the final overall survival analysis after 183 deaths (69%) in 266 patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and 201 (76%) in 265 receiving bevacizumab plus capecitabine in the per-protocol population, median overall survival was 30\u00b72 months (95% CI 25\u00b76-32\u00b76 months) versus 26\u00b71 months (22\u00b73-29\u00b70), respectively. The stratified HR was 1\u00b702 (97\u00b75% RCI -\u221e to 1\u00b726; repeated p=0\u00b70070), indicating non-inferiority. The unstratified Cox model (HR 1\u00b713 [97\u00b75% RCI -\u221e to 1\u00b739]; repeated p=0\u00b7061) did not support the primary analysis. Intent-to-treat analyses were consistent with the per-protocol results. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (54 [19%] of 284 patients in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group vs 5 [2%] of 277 patients in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group), hand-foot syndrome (1 [<1%] vs 43 [16%]), peripheral neuropathy (39 [14%] vs 1 [<1%]), leucopenia (20 [7%] vs 1 [<1%]), and hypertension (12 [4%] vs 16 [6%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 65 (23%) of 284 patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and 68 (25%) of 277 receiving bevacizumab plus capecitabine. Deaths in two (1%) of 284 patients in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group were deemed by the investigator to be treatment-related. No treatment-related deaths occurred in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group. ### interpretation bevacizumab plus capecitabine represents a valid first-line treatment option for HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, offering good tolerability without compromising overall survival compared with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel. Although progression-free survival with the bevacizumab plus capecitabine combination is inferior to that noted with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel , we suggest that physicians should consider possible predictive risk factors for overall survival , individual 's treatment priorities , and the differing safety profiles . ### funding Roche.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27501767/"}

To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab and cetuximab in the treatment of individuals with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). ### Data Sources Searches of main electronic databases were conducted in April and May 2005. ### Review Methods For the assessment of bevacizumab, trials were included if they recruited participants with untreated metastatic CRC for first-line treatment. Only trials comparing bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan and/or established fluorouracil (5-FU)-containing or releasing regimens given as first-line therapy were included. For the assessment of cetuximab, trials were included if they recruited participants with epidermal growth-factor receptor-expressing metastatic CRC who had previously failed irinotecan-including therapy. Independent cost-effectiveness models of bevacizumab and cetuximab were developed using survival modelling methods. ### results Adding bevacizumab to irinotecan in combination with 5-FU/folic acid (FA) plus irinotecan resulted in a statistically significant increase in median overall survival (OS) of 4.7 months. Adding bevacizumab to 5-FU/FA resulted in a non-significant increase in median OS of 3.7 months within one study and 7.7 months in another. Adding bevacizumab to irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (IFL) resulted in a statistically significant increase in median progression-free survival (PFS) of 4.4 months. Adding bevacizumab to 5-FU/FA resulted in a statistically significant increase in median PFS of 3.7 months, and a statistically significant increase in time to disease progression of 3.8 months compared to FU/FA alone. An overall tumour response rate of 44.8% was reported for bevacizumab plus IFL compared to 34.8% for IFL plus placebo. This addition was statistically significant. The addition of bevacizumab to 5-FU/FA resulted in a significant difference in tumour response rate within one study, but not another. bevacizumab in combination with IFL or 5-FU/FA was observed to result in an increase of grade 3/4 adverse events. The independent health economic assessment suggests that the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab plus IFL is unlikely to be better than pound 46,853 per life-year gained (LYG); the cost-utility of bevacizumab plus IFL is unlikely to be better than pound 62,857 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab plus 5-FU/FA versus 5-FU/FA is unlikely to be better than pound 84,607 per LYG; the cost-utility of bevacizumab plus 5-FU/FA versus 5-FU/FA is unlikely to be better than pound 88,658 per QALY gained. A Phase II trial reported a median OS duration of 8.6 months for patients receiving cetuximab plus irinotecan , plus a median time to progression of 4.1 months , a tumour response rate of 22.9 % and suggested that treatment with cetuximab in combination with irinotecan is associated with significantly more adverse events ( any grade 3 or grade 4 adverse event ) than cetuximab monotherapy . The single arm study of cetuximab plus irinotecan reported a median OS duration of 8.4 months, a median time to progression of 2.9 months and a tumour response rate of 15.2%. The cost-effectiveness model suggested that the expected survival duration of patients receiving cetuximab plus irinotecan is 0.79 years (9.5 months) when the proposed continuation rule is applied. In order for cetuximab plus irinotecan to achieve a cost-utility ratio of pound 30,000 per QALY gained, treatment with cetuximab plus irinotecan must provide an additional 0.65 life years (7.8 months) over treatment with active/best supportive care, implying that survival in the active/best supportive care group must be 0.14 life years (1.7 months) or less. ### conclusions The trials indicate that bevacizumab in combination with 5-FU/FA, and bevacizumab in combination with IFL, is clinically effective in comparison to standard chemotherapy options for the first-line treatment of metastatic CRC. The health economic analysis suggests that the marginal cost-utility of bevacizumab plus IFL versus IFL is unlikely to be better than pound 62,857 per QALY gained, and the marginal cost-utility of bevacizumab plus 5-FU/FA versus 5-FU/FA is unlikely to be better than pound 88,658 per QALY gained. There is no direct evidence to demonstrate whether cetuximab in combination with irinotecan improves health-related quality of life or OS in comparison to active/best supportive care or oxaliplatin plus 5-FU/FA, although the evidence on tumour response rates suggests that cetuximab plus irinotecan has some clinical activity. While it is difficult to suggest whether cetuximab represents value for money, indirect comparisons suggest that the incremental cost-utility of cetuximab plus irinotecan is unlikely to be better than pound 30,000 per QALY gained. This review highlights a number of areas for further research, including clarifying the true impact of first-line bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan and/or infusional 5-FU/FA, without subsequent bevacizumab treatment following disease progression, on OS in patients with metastatic CRC who are representative of the typical population of CRC patients in England and Wales. Further research concerning the impact of therapies on health-related quality of life is essential.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17346499/"}

At the 4-year follow-up, we report long-term outcomes, response to subsequent therapies, and the predictive value of molecular and genetic characteristics. ### Patients And Methods Patients with CLL were randomly assigned to 2 years of venetoclax (VenR for the first six cycles) or six cycles of BR. PFS, overall survival (OS), peripheral-blood minimal residual disease (MRD) status, genomic complexity (GC), and gene mutations were assessed. ### results Of 389 patients, 194 were assigned to VenR and 195 to BR.

The patient was later hospitalized for symptoms of chronic digoxin toxicity, including prolonged nausea, diarrhea, weakness, and lack of appetite. The patient had a long history of digoxin use for control of his atrial fibrillation but experienced signs and symptoms of toxicity only after the addition of dronedarone. ### discussion Both the Naranjo and Drug Interaction Probability Scales indicated a \"probable\" relationship between the development of digoxin toxicity and dronedarone. Due to a p-glycoprotein-mediated interaction, dronedarone is able to decrease the renal clearance of digoxin, thus putting patients at risk for potentially fatal digoxin toxicity. ### conclusion This is the second case report detailing dronedarone-induced digoxin toxicity and the first to focus on chronic digoxin toxicity. The presentation, possible causes, and drug-drug interactions associated with digoxin toxicity are described. This report aims to increase clinicians' awareness of this possible complication. It is recommended that digoxin be discontinued prior to initiating dronedarone.

Here, we aimed to further elucidate the KSR1-regulated signalling in response to genotoxic agents in breast cancer. Stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry ( MS ) was implemented to globally characterise cellular protein levels induced by KSR1 in the presence of doxorubicin or etoposide . The acquired proteomic signature was compared and GO-STRING analysis was subsequently performed to illustrate the activated functional signalling networks. Furthermore, the clinical associations of KSR1 with identified targets and their relevance in chemotherapy response were examined in breast cancer patients. We reveal a comprehensive repertoire of thousands of proteins identified in each dataset and compare the unique proteomic profiles as well as functional connections modulated by KSR1 after doxorubicin (Doxo-KSR1) or etoposide (Etop-KSR1) stimulus. From the up-regulated top hits, several proteins, including STAT1, ISG15 and TAP1 are also found to be positively associated with KSR1 expression in patient samples. Moreover, high KSR1 expression, as well as high abundance of these proteins, is correlated with better survival in breast cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy.

This study compared brimonidine with latanoprost as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. ### background Patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension often require >1 medication to achieve control of intraocular pressure (IOP). Both brimonidine and latanoprost effectively lower IOP, but no previously reported clinical trials have directly compared these agents as adjunctive therapy. ### methods This was a prospective, randomized, investigator-masked, multicenter, parallel-design clinical trial. Forty patients (69 study eyes) with uncontrolled IOP of < or =34 mm Hg while using a topical beta-blocker plus dorzolamide or pilocarpine were randomly assigned to receive either brimonidine 0.2% BID or latanoprost 0.005% QD over 6 months as adjunctive therapy. Tolerability was assessed by reports of adverse events, and efficacy was determined by reduction in IOP from baseline. Clinical success was defined as the achievement of a > or =15% reduction in IOP from baseline. ### results There were no significant between-group differences in any demographic variable. Most patients in each group were white, had open-angle glaucoma, and were being treated with a nonselective beta-blocker and dorzolamide. When brimonidine or latanoprost was used as an adjunctive agent with a beta-blocker and dorzolamide or pilocarpine, the rates of clinical success at month 1 were 85% (17/20 patients) with brimonidine versus 65% (13/20 patients) with latanoprost (P = 0.144).

Among the patients with an inadequate IOP-lowering response (<15% reduction from baseline), the mean IOP reduction was 0.36+/-0.66 mm Hg with latanoprost (n = 7) and 0.50+/-2.18 mm Hg with brimonidine (n = 3). brimonidine and latanoprost had comparable IOP-lowering efficacy in patients receiving concomitant pilocarpine therapy (mean change in IOP of -4.23 mm Hg vs -3.75 mm Hg, P = 0.173). In patients concurrently treated with dorzolamide, brimonidine produced a mean change in IOP of -5.29 mm Hg, compared with a mean change of -3.21 mm Hg in the latanoprost group (P = 0.159). Both brimonidine and latanoprost were well tolerated. Few adverse events leading to discontinuation were observed with either drug regimen (n = 2 with brimonidine; n = 0 with latanoprost). ### conclusions Both brimonidine 0.2% BID and latanoprost 0.005% QD were well-tolerated and reduced IOP in most patients when used as third-line adjunctive therapy. However, clinical success was achieved by 17 of 20 patients (85%) who received brimonidine, compared with 13 of 20 patients (65%) who received latanoprost (P = 0.144). These results suggest that brimonidine 0.2% BID may be more reliable than latanoprost 0.005% QD as adjunctive therapy for glaucoma and ocular hypertension.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10823361/"}

BPTF functions in promoting resistance to doxorubicin and etoposide, but not paclitaxel, and may be selective to cancer cells, as a similar effect was not observed in embryonic stem cells. Sensitization to doxorubicin and etoposide with BPTF knockdown (KD) was associated with increased DNA damage, topoisomerase II (Top2) crosslinking and autophagy; however, there was only a modest increase in apoptosis and no increase in senescence. Sensitization to doxorubicin was confirmed in vivo with the syngeneic 4T1 breast tumor model using both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BPTF. The effects of BPTF inhibition in vivo are autophagy dependent, based on genetic autophagy inhibition. Finally, treatment of 4T1, 66cl4, 4T07, MDA-MB-231 but not ER positive 67NR and MCF7 breast cancer cells with the selective BPTF bromodomain inhibitor, AU1, recapitulates genetic BPTF inhibition, including in vitro sensitization to doxorubicin, increased Top2-DNA crosslinks and DNA damage. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that BPTF provides resistance to the antitumor activity of Top2 poisons, preventing the resolution of Top2 crosslinking and associated autophagy. These studies suggest that BPTF can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors to enhance the effectiveness of Top2-targeted cancer chemotherapeutic drugs.

The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is on the rise in the US despite a drop in cigarette smoking rates.

HPV-related SCCHN has a high cure rate, which contributes to the stable death rates despite the increased incidence. Up to half of patients with SCCHN will develop recurrence. For these patients, the first clinical decision is whether the recurrence is potentially treatable for cure, or is incurable. For those deemed potentially curable, surgical or radiation-based therapies, or both, are undertaken. For those who have incurable recurrences, the goals are palliation and possibly prolongation of life - average survivals are in the range of 6-12 months depending on the type of recurrence and other factors. Several chemotherapy drugs are active in SCCHN , most notably the platinum compounds , taxanes , fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , methotrexate and cetuximab .

Enhancing the effectiveness of docetaxel for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an unmet clinical need. Preclinical studies demonstrated that high-dose pantoprazole can prevent or delay resistance to docetaxel via the inhibition of autophagy in several solid tumor xenografts. ### Materials And Methods Men with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >10 ng/mL were eligible for enrolment. Men received intravenous pantoprazole (240 mg) prior to docetaxel (75 mg/m ### results Between November 2012 and March 2015, 21 men with a median age of 70 years (range, 58-81) were treated (median, 6 cycles; range, 2-11). Men had received prior systemic therapies (median, 1; range, 0-3), and 14 had received abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. PSA response rate was 52% (11/21), which did not meet the prespecified criterion (\u226513/21 responders) to proceed to stage 2 of the study. At interim analysis with a median follow-up of 17 months, 18 (86%) men were deceased (15 castration-resistant prostate cancer, 2 unknown, 1 radiation complication). Of the men with RECIST measurable disease, the radiographic partial response rate was 31% (4/13). The estimated median overall survival was 15.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.3-19.6) and median PFS was 5.3 months (95% CI, 2.6-12.9). There were no toxic deaths, and all adverse events were attributed to docetaxel. ### conclusion The combination of docetaxel and pantoprazole was tolerable, but the resultant clinical activity was not sufficient to meet the ambitious predefined target to warrant further testing. ### Implications For Practice To date, no docetaxel combination regimen has reported superior efficacy over docetaxel alone in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The PANDORA trial has demonstrated that the combination of high dose pantoprazole with docetaxel is tolerable , but the clinical activity was not sufficient to warrant further testing . The chemotherapy standard of care for men with mCRPC remains docetaxel with prednisone. Future studies of autophagy inhibitors will need to measure autophagy inhibition accurately and determine the degree of autophagy inhibition required to produce a meaningful clinical response.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30952818/"}

At first, lupus nephritis with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome was suspected because of prolongation of APTT, existence of lupus anticoagulant and elevation of serum anticardiolipin antibody titer (IgM) in addition to positive ANA, lymphocytopenia and the biologically false positive test for syphilis (BFPTS). On day 28 of hospitalization, renal biopsy findings revealed severe endocapillary cell damage, such as swelling and proliferation of endothelial cells, fragmentation and double contour of the basement membrane walls, which were located only in the capillary lumens with a few thrombi. Immunofluorescent micrography revealed the absence of specific immunoglobulin or complement deposit. Therefore, the diagnosis of lupus nephritis was negated as these findings were suggestive of characteristic glomerulopathy due to primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She was treated initially with oral prednisolone 60 mg and intravenous infusion of heparin 20,000 units daily. Moreover, cyclophosphamide 750 mg was administered intravenously as pulse therapy on day 13 as her serum level of CH50 had fallen suddenly, and hemodialysis was necessary because her renal function had deteriorated and she was suffering from cough and orthopnea with overhydratin.

Chemotherapy is one of major therapeutic regimens for neuroblastoma (NB) in children. However, recurrence and metastasis associated with poor prognosis caused by acquired multidrug resistance remains a challenge. There is a great need to achieve new insight into the molecular mechanism of drug resistance in NB. The aim of this study is to identify novel drug sensitivity-related biomarkers as well as new therapeutic targets to overcome chemoresistance. ### methods We proteome-wide quantitatively compared protein expression of two NB cell lines with different drug sensitivities, isolated from the same patient prior to and following chemotherapy. Annexin A2 (ANXA2) emerged as a key factor contributing to drug resistance in NB. Then, we assessed the correlation of ANXA2 expression and clinical characteristics using a tissue microarray. Further, the roles of ANXA2 in chemoresistance for NB and the underlying mechanisms were studied by using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in vitro and vivo. ### results First in total, over 6000 proteins were identified, and there were about 460 significantly regulated proteins which were up- or down-regulated by greater than two folds. We screened out ANXA2 which was upregulated by more than 12-fold in the chemoresistant NB cell line, and it might be involved in the drug resistance of NB. Then, using a tissue chip containing 42 clinical NB samples, we found that strong expression of ANXA2 was closely associated with advanced stage, greater number of chemotherapy cycles, tumor metastasis and poor prognosis. Following knockdown of ANXA2 in NB cell line SK-N-BE(2 ) using shRNA , we demonstrate enhanced drug sensitivity for doxorubicin ( 2.77-fold ) and etoposide ( 7.87-fold ) compared with control . Pro-apoptotic genes such as AIF and cleaved-PARP were upregulated. Inhibiting ANXA2 expression attenuated transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB via down-regulated nuclear translocation of subunit p50.

Successful inhibition of angiogenesis with the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab has improved the efficacy seen with standard cytotoxic therapy in NSCLC. The addition of bevacizumab to first-line chemotherapy improved response rate and progression free survival and added 2 months to median overall survival for those patients with advanced stage NSCLC on the treatment arm of E4599. bevacizumab is now a standard agent to add to frontline carboplatin and paclitaxel for patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC who meet the eligibility criteria from the landmark E4599 trial. Unfortunately about half of all patients are not eligible either because they have squamous histology, brain metastases, or are on anti-coagulation. Ongoing trials are further exploring the safety of bevacizumab in these patient populations, as well as in combination with other cytotoxic regimens. Exploration of other applications of bevacizumab in the second-line and adjuvant setting are ongoing as well. The largest class of drugs that block angiogenesis are the multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the VEGF receptor (VEGFR). These drugs are still in development, and though two are now on the market for treating other malignancies, their role in NSCLC is under investigation. These agents have the advantages of hitting multiple targets, convenient oral administration, and potential for lower cost. Their lack of target specificity leads to unexpected toxicity, but also promising efficacy. For example , the overall objective response rate of 9.5 % with single agent sunitinib compares similarly to that of pemetrexed or docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC patients , but toxicity , notably fatigue , lead to discontinuation in 38 % of patients . Hypertension, hemorrhage and cavitation are common toxicities amongst this class of agents. Rash, fatigue, myalgia, and hand-foot syndrome are more specifically seen with TKIs. These compounds may also be synergistic or additive with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs and other novel compounds. In early trials sorafenib as a single agent has shown no clinical response in previously treated NSCLC patients, whereas clinical benefit in combination with erlotinib or chemotherapy has been seen in early studies. vandetanib has demonstrated objective responses as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in previously treated NSCLC patients. A phase I trial of AZD2171 with carboplatin and paclitaxel in newly diagnosed advanced stage NSCLC also demonstrated promising results with 6 of 15 patients achieving partial responses. NSCLC specific trials are also underway, or in development for pazopanib, axitinib, AMG 706, XL647, enzastaurin, and other TKIs. Other anti-angiogenesis agents with different mechanisms of action include thalidomide and its derivatives, monoclonal antibodies to the VEGFRs, and VEGF Trap, a chimeric molecule which combines extracellular portions of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 with the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G1 to form a molecule that binds and \"traps\" VEGF. Despite modest improvements, prognosis continues to be poor for patients with advanced NSCLC. bevacizumab is a first step into the world of angiogenesis inhibitors for NSCLC and though it only offers a modest survival benefit in a limited patient population, it paves the way for the development of the next generation of anti-angiogenesis inhibitors. We can hope that further improvements in survival will follow.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17634832/"}

Because of our interest in polyamine biosynthesis and metabolism and the known involvement of calcium in the induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) by serum refeeding of cultured cells, the effects of verapamil on the serum-stimulated ODC activity in two hamster pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were examined. In plateau phase well-differentiated (WD) PaCa and poorly differentiated (PD) PaCa cells, a dose-dependent inhibition of the 4-h serum induction of ODC was seen at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 microM verapamil. At the higher concentrations of verapamil, the inhibition of ODC induction was comparable to that achieved with 5 mM alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, a specific enzyme inhibitor of ODC) and greater than that seen with 2 mM EGTA plus calcium-depleted serum. Log phase PD PaCa cells, included for comparison, showed less ODC induction with serum and lesser degrees of inhibition of the response to serum refeeding with verapamil, DFMO, and calcium depletion. No direct inhibition of the ODC enzyme was found when verapamil was added at the time the activity was measured. Based on our present data, a possible influence of intracellular calcium pools in the verapamil effect on ODC activity is unclear.

In addition, we aimed to explore the pharmacokinetic parameters of irinotecan and capecitabine when used in different sequences of administration, with irinotecan infusion either prior to or after the first intake of capecitabine. ### Patients And Methods One hundred patients were included: 43 patients were recruited into an extended phase I trial of alternating escalation in dose of both drugs where irinotecan was administered intravenously (i.v) on day 1 after first intake of capecitabine taken from days 1-14 twice daily, with cycles repeated every 3 weeks. After the determination of recommended dose a further 57 patients were treated in a phase II evaluation with the reverse sequence of drugs on day 1. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in patients treated at the recommended dose in two cohorts of patients in which the sequence of the first administration of each drug was reversed. ### results The MTD of the combination was determined as irinotecan 300 mg/m2, with capecitabine 2000 mg/m2/day. Dose limiting toxicities were neutropenia and diarrhoea. The recommended dose is irinotecan intravenous (i.v.) 250 mg/m2 day 1 and capecitabine 2000 mg/m2/day days 1-14, every 3 weeks. Treatment was well tolerated, with diarrhoea the most common serious toxicity. Response rate in the phase II cohort was 42% [95% confidence interval (CI) 29% to 56%]. Median duration of response was 7.7 months (95% CI 7.5-8.9). Median time to progression was 8.3 months (95% CI 5.8-10). No significant effect on irinotecan pharmacokinetics was observed whatever the intake of capecitabine before or after irinotecan infusion. An effect of irinotecan on capecitabine and some capecitabine metabolites was observed, but irinotecan did not effect 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pharmacokinetics. ### conclusions irinotecan in combination with capecitabine is a well tolerated regimen with an activity comparable to, but more convenient than, irinotecan-5-FU i.v. combinations in patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether combination therapy with vancomycin and TZP is associated with an incidence of AKI in pediatric patients higher than that in those on combination therapy with vancomycin and cefepime . ### methods We performed a retrospective single-center matched-cohort study of pediatric patients who received vancomycin in combination with TZP or cefepime between January 2015 and June 2016. The patients were matched according to chronic disease, age, sex, and number of concomitant nephrotoxic medications at the time of combination antibiotic therapy. The primary outcome was incidence of AKI. Secondary outcomes included differences between groups in time to AKI, resolution of AKI, and effect of vancomycin trough levels on the incidence of nephrotoxicity. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare categorical and continuous variables between treatment groups. Conditional Poisson regression was used to assess the association between AKI and treatment groups. Stratified log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models with shared frailty were used to compare the times to AKI according to treatment group. ### results Two hundred twenty-eight matched patients were included. AKI developed in 9 (7.9%) of 114 and 33 (28.9%) of 114 patients in the cefepime and TZP groups, respectively (P < .001).

The incidence profile was very similar in phases I and II. No objective responses were documented but 53% of the patients achieved stable disease as best response to therapy. ### conclusions capecitabine 1250 mg/m(2) twice daily 14 of 21 days and gefitinib at 250 mg/day can be safely administered in combination. The combination is relatively well tolerated. There were no objective responses, although an interesting stabilisation rate was documented, in previously treated advanced CRC patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18208793/"}

Preclinical models predict synergy in combination. ### methods We conducted a single-group, phase 2 study of daily oral ibrutinib and venetoclax in patients, as compared with historical controls. Patients commenced ibrutinib monotherapy at a dose of 560 mg per day. After 4 weeks, venetoclax was added in stepwise, weekly increasing doses to 400 mg per day. Both drugs were continued until progression or an unacceptable level of adverse events. The primary end point was the rate of complete response at week 16. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by flow cytometry in bone marrow and by allele-specific oligonucleotide-polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) in blood. ### results The study included 24 patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma (23 patients) or previously untreated mantle-cell lymphoma (1 patient). Patients were 47 to 81 years of age, and the number of previous treatments ranged from none to six. Half the patients had aberrations of TP53, and 75% had a high-risk prognostic score. The complete response rate according to computed tomography at week 16 was 42%, which was higher than the historical result of 9% at this time point with ibrutinib monotherapy (P<0.001). The rate of complete response as assessed by positron-emission tomography was 62% at week 16 and 71% overall. MRD clearance was confirmed by flow cytometry in 67% of the patients and by ASO-PCR in 38%. In a time-to-event analysis, 78% of the patients with a response were estimated to have an ongoing response at 15 months. The tumor lysis syndrome occurred in 2 patients. Common side effects were generally low grade and included diarrhea (in 83% of the patients), fatigue (in 75%), and nausea or vomiting (in 71%). ### conclusions In this study involving historical controls, dual targeting of BTK and BCL2 with ibrutinib and venetoclax was consistent with improved outcomes in patients with mantle-cell lymphoma who had been predicted to have poor outcomes with current therapy.

The chloroethylating nitrosoureas ( lomustine , fotemustine , cystemustine ( BCNU ) and methylating agents temozolomide ( TMZ ) , dacarbazine ( DTIC ) , procarbazine ) have documented activity in metastatic malignant melanoma with single agent response rates of 15 - 25 % . Chloroethylating agents form chloroethyl adducts at the O6 position of guanine, resulting in N1-guanine, N3-cytosine interstrand crosslinks which are cytotoxic. Methylating agents attack DNA at multiple sites, although most of their cytotoxic activity is due to the formation of methyl adducts at the O6 position of guanine. The presence of these adducts results in a futile recycling of the mismatch repair pathway resulting in DNA strand breaks and apoptotic cell death. An intact mismatch repair system is required to achieve their cytotoxic effect. Repair of adducts by the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) impairs the cytotoxic action of both methylating and chloroethylating agents, and mediates a major resistance pathway to these drugs. During DNA repair, irreversible inactivation of AGT occurs. To regenerate AGT activity, synthesis of new molecules is required. Increased but variable AGT activity is found in malignant melanoma, is higher in metastatic lesions than in primary tumours, and is higher in tumours than normal skin. Expression of AGT activity, is higher in melanoma metastases after DTIC chemotherapy compared to expression prior to therapy. TMZ alone depletes human AGT in tumour tissue and peripheral blood progenitor cells. As the t1/2 of TMZ via the oral route is short (approximately 1.8 hours), and the anti-tumour activity of the drug is known to be schedule-dependent, twice daily or prolonged administration schedules of TMZ prevent regeneration of AGT, and render tumour cells more sensitive to the drug. O6-benzylguanine (BG) is a potent AGT inactivating agent. BG and its analogues reduce AGT activity, and increase the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of both methylating and chloroethylating agents. In clinical trials, non-toxic doses of BG deplete AGT to undetectable levels. AGT depleting agents in combination with methylating and chloroethylating agents are now in clinical testing, and may result in greater clinical efficacy in metastatic malignant melanoma.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11007934/"}

The intensive polychemotherapy regimen eBEACOPP ( bleomycin , etoposide , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , vincristine , procarbazine , and prednisone in escalated doses ) is very active in patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin 's lymphoma , albeit at the expense of severe toxicities . Individual patients might be cured with less burdensome therapy. We investigated whether metabolic response determined by PET after two cycles of standard regimen eBEACOPP (PET-2) would allow adaption of treatment intensity, increasing it for PET-2-positive patients and reducing it for PET-2-negative patients. ### methods In this open-label, randomised, parallel-group phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18-60 years with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma in 301 hospitals and private practices in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. After central review of PET-2, patients were assigned (1:1) to one of two parallel treatment groups on the basis of their PET-2 result. Patients with positive PET-2 were randomised to receive six additional cycles of either standard eBEACOPP (8\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP in total) or eBEACOPP with rituximab (8\u2008\u00d7\u2008R-eBEACOPP). Those with negative PET-2 were randomised between standard treatment with six additional cycles of eBEACOPP (8\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP) or experimental treatment with two additional cycles (4\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP). A protocol amendment in June, 2011, introduced a reduction of standard therapy to 6\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP; after this point, patients with positive PET-2 were no longer randomised and were all assigned to receive 6\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP and patients with negative PET-2 were randomly assigned to 6\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP (standard) or 4\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP (experimental). Randomisation was done centrally using the minimisation method including a random component, stratified according to centre, age (<45 vs \u226545 years), stage (IIB, IIIA vs IIIB, IV), international prognostic score (0-2 vs 3-7), and sex. eBEACOPP was given as previously described; rituximab was given intravenously at a dose of 375 mg/m ### findings Between May 14, 2008, and July 18, 2014, we recruited 2101 patients, of whom 137 were found ineligible before randomisation and a further 19 were found ineligible after randomisation. Among 434 randomised patients (217 per arm) with positive PET-2, 5-year progression-free survival was 89\u00b77% (95% CI 85\u00b74-94\u00b70) with eBEACOPP and 88\u00b71% (83\u00b75-92\u00b77) with R-eBEACOPP (log-rank p=0\u00b746). Patients with negative PET-2 randomly assigned to either 8\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP or 6\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP (n=504) or 4\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP (n=501) had 5-year progression-free survival of 90\u00b78% (95% CI 87\u00b79-93\u00b77) and 92\u00b72% (89\u00b74-95\u00b70), respectively (difference 1\u00b74%, 95% CI -2\u00b77 to 5\u00b74). 4\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP was associated with fewer severe infections (40 [8%] of 498 vs 75 [15%] of 502) and organ toxicities (38 [8%] of 498 vs 91 [18%] of 502) than were 8\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP or 6\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP in PET-2-negative patients. Ten treatment-related deaths occurred: four in the PET-2-positive cohort (one [<1%] in the 8\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP group, three [1%] in the 8\u2008\u00d7\u2008R-eBEACOPP group) and six in the PET-2-negative group (six [1%] in the 8\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP or 6\u2008\u00d7\u2008eBEACOPP group). ### interpretation The favourable outcome of patients treated with eBEACOPP could not be improved by adding rituximab after positive PET-2. PET-2 negativity allows reduction to only four cycles of eBEACOPP without loss of tumour control. PET-2-guided eBEACOPP provides outstanding efficacy for all patients and increases overall survival by reducing treatment-related risks for patients with negative PET-2. We recommend this PET-2-guided treatment strategy for patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma. ### funding Deutsche Krebshilfe, Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research, and Roche Pharma AG.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29061295/"}

Mycosis fungoides is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a malignant, chronic disease initially affecting the skin. Several therapies are available, which may induce clinical remission for a time. ### objectives To assess the effects of interventions for mycosis fungoides in all stages of the disease. ### Search Methods We searched the following databases up to January 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2010), and LILACS (from 1982). We also checked reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant RCTs. We searched online trials registries for further references to unpublished trials and undertook a separate search for adverse effects of interventions for mycosis fungoides in non-RCTs in MEDLINE in May 2011. ### Selection Criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for mycosis fungoides in people with any stage of the disease. At least 90% of participants in the trials must have been diagnosed with mycosis fungoides (Alibert-Bazin-type). ### Data Collection And Analysis Two authors independently assessed eligibility and methodological quality for each study and carried out data extraction. We resolved any disagreement by discussion. Primary outcomes were the impact on quality of life and the safety of interventions. When available, we reported on our secondary outcomes, which were the improvement or clearance of skin lesions, disease-free intervals, survival rates, relapse rates, and rare adverse effects. When possible, we combined homogeneous studies for meta-analysis. We used The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the internal validity of all included studies in six different domains. ### Main Results The review included 14 RCTs involving 675 participants, covering a wide range of interventions. Eleven of the included trials assessed participants in clinical stages IA to IIB only (please see Table 1 for definitions of these stages).Internal validity was considerably low in studies with a high or unclear risk of bias. The main reasons for this were low methodological quality or missing data, even after we contacted the study authors, and a mean dropout rate of 26% (0% to 72%). Study size was generally small with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 103 participants. Only one study provided a long enough follow-up for reliable survival analysis.Included studies assessed topical treatments, such as imiquimod, peldesine, hypericin, nitrogen mustard, as well as intralesional injections of interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1). The light therapies investigated included psoralen plus ultraviolet A light (PUVA), extracorporeal photopheresis (photochemotherapy), and visible light. Oral treatments included acitretin, bexarotene, and methotrexate. Treatment with parenteral systemic agents consisted of denileukin diftitox; a combination of chemotherapy and electron beam radiation; and intramuscular injections of active transfer factor. Nine studies evaluated therapies by using an active comparator; five were placebo-controlled RCTs.Twelve studies reported on common adverse effects, while only two assessed quality of life. None of these studies compared the health-related quality of life of participants undergoing different treatments. Most of the reported adverse effects were attributed to the interventions. Systemic treatments , and here in particular a combined therapeutic regimen of chemotherapy and electron beam , bexarotene , or denileukin diftitox , showed more adverse effects than topical or skin-directed treatments .In the included studies, clearance rates ranged from 0% to 83%, and improvement ranged from 0% to 88%. The meta-analysis combining the results of 2 trials comparing the effect of IFN-\u03b1 and PUVA versus PUVA alone showed no significant difference in the relative risk of clearance: 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.31). None of the included studies demonstrated a significant increase in disease-free intervals, relapse, or overall survival. ### Authors Conclusions This review identified trial evidence for a range of different topical and systemic interventions for mycosis fungoides. Because of substantial heterogeneity in design, small sample sizes, and low methodological quality, the comparative safety and efficacy of these interventions cannot be established on the basis of the included RCTs. Taking into account the possible serious adverse effects and the limited availability of efficacy data, topical and skin-directed treatments are recommended first, especially in the early stages of disease. More aggressive therapeutic regimens may show improvement or clearance of lesions, but they also result in more adverse effects; therefore, they are to be considered with caution. Larger studies with comparable, clearly-defined end points for all stages of mycosis fungoides, and a focus on safety, quality of life, and duration of remission as part of the outcome measures, are necessary.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22972128/"}

Also, previous systematic reviews have not provided quantitative measures of preventive effectiveness. The purpose of this research was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to determine the safety and effectiveness of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis used in SCD patients. ### methods We searched in PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, POPLine and Cochrane library, for the period spanning January 1990 to April 2018.

While the clinical benefit of proteasome inhibitors (PIs) for multiple myeloma (MM) treatment remains unchallenged, dose-limiting toxicities and the inevitable emergence of drug resistance limit their long-term utility. Disease eradication is compromised by drug resistance that is either present de novo or therapy-induced, which accounts for the majority of tumor relapses and MM-related deaths. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a broad class of RNA molecules, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), that do not encode proteins but play a major role in regulating the fundamental cellular processes that control cancer initiation, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. While lncRNAs have recently attracted significant attention as therapeutic targets to potentially improve cancer treatment, identification of lncRNAs that are deregulated in cells resistant to PIs has not been previously addressed. We have modeled drug resistance by generating three MM cell lines with acquired resistance to either bortezomib , carfilzomib , or ixazomib . Genome-wide profiling identified lncRNAs that were significantly deregulated in all three PIresistant cell lines relative to the drug-sensitive parental cell line. Strikingly, certain lncRNAs deregulated in the three PI-resistant cell lines were also deregulated in MM plasma cells isolated from newly diagnosed patients compared to healthy plasma cells. Taken together, these preliminary studies strongly suggest that lncRNAs represent potential therapeutic targets to prevent or overcome drug resistance. More investigations are ongoing to expand these initial studies in a greater number of MM patients to better define lncRNAs signatures that contribute to PI resistance in MM.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27782060/"}

Competing risks analyses were performed to estimate cumulative incidence of cardiotoxicity. ### results Risk factors associated with cardiotoxicity within 2 years of doxorubicin administration included age [ adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR ) = 1.02 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.00 - 1.04 ; p = 0.05 ] , metastasis ( aHR = 2.66 ; 95 % CI 1.36 - 5.20 ; p < 0.01 ) , and concomitant trastuzumab ( aHR = 4.08 ; 95 % CI 2.31 - 7.21 ; p\u2009<\u20090.01). The cumulative incidence of patients with cardiotoxicity was 6.1% at 2\u00a0years (without substantial change from about 9\u00a0months)and 20.2% at 2\u00a0years (without substantial change from about 15\u00a0months) after initiation of doxorubicin-containing therapy without and with trastuzumab, respectively. ### conclusions Susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity within 2\u00a0years of doxorubicin initiation in breast cancer patients was elevated with old age, metastasis, and concomitant trastuzumab. Regular imaging monitoring at least up to 9\u00a0months after doxorubicin initiation in patients treated without concomitant trastuzumab, and 15\u00a0months in patients treated with concomitant trastuzumab, is needed for early detection of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32468335/"}

The present study examined the activational effects of acute and chronic nicotine on the behavior of adult male SHRs, relative to Wistar Kyoto (WKY) controls. Experiment 1 verified baseline strain differences in open-field locomotor activity. Experiment 2 tested for baseline strain differences in rotational behavior using a Rotorat apparatus. Adult SHR and WKY rats were then exposed to a 7-day regimen of 0.6mg/kg/d s.c. nicotine, or saline, prior to each assessment. A separate group of SHRs underwent similar training, but was pre-treated with mecamylamine, a cholinergic antagonist. nicotine sensitization, context conditioning, and mecamylamine effects were then tested. Baseline strain differences were observed in open-field performance and in the number of full rotations in the Rotorat apparatus, but not in the number of 90\u00b0 rotations or direction changes. In these latter measures, SHRs displayed weaker nicotine-induced rotational suppression than WKYs. Both strains expressed nicotine-induced sensitization of rotational activity, but evidence for strain differences in sensitization was ambiguous; context conditioning was not observed.

Pancreatic cancer is expected to be the second deadliest malignancy in the USA by 2020. The survival rates for patients with other gastrointestinal malignancies have increased consistently during the past 30 years; unfortunately, however, the outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer have not changed significantly. Although surgery remains the only curative treatment for pancreatic cancer, therapeutic strategies based on initial resection have not substantially improved the survival of patients with resectable disease over the past 25 years; presently, more than 80% of patients suffer disease relapse after resection. Preclinical evidence that pancreatic cancer is a systemic disease suggests a possible benefit for early administration of systemic therapy in these patients. In locally advanced disease, the role of chemoradiotherapy is increasingly being questioned, particularly considering the results of the LAP-07 trial. Novel biomarkers are clearly needed to identify subsets of patients likely to benefit from chemoradiotherapy. In the metastatic setting , FOLFIRINOX ( folinic acid , 5-fluorouracil , irinotecan , and oxaliplatin ) , and nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine have yielded only modest improvements in survival .

Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is an advanced stage of the disease when the disease has spread beyond the original organ.

Further data were derived from the manufacturers' submissions for LAP + AI and TRA + AI. ### Review Methods A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LAP + AI and TRA + AI was undertaken. As it was deemed inappropriate to compare LAP + AI with TRA + AI, two separate assessments of cost-effectiveness versus AIs alone were undertaken. ### results Three trials were included in the systematic review [the patient populations of the efficacy and safety of lapatinib combined with letrozole (EGF30008) trial, the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab combined with anastrozole (TAnDEM) trial and the efficacy and safety of letrozole combined with trastuzumab (eLEcTRA) trial]. As a result of differences in the exclusion criteria and because one trial was halted prematurely, comparisons across trials were believed to be inappropriate and meta-analysis was not possible. Individually, however, the findings from the trials all suggest that LAP + AI or TRA + AI results in improved progression-free survival and/or time to progression when compared with AIs alone. The trials do not show a statistically significant benefit in terms of overall survival. Two separate economic analyses were conducted based on the completed trials; neither LAP + AI nor TRA + AI was found to be cost-effective when compared with AI monotherapy. ### limitations Because of differences in the EGF30008 and the TAnDEM trials, the Assessment Group believes the indirect comparisons analyses conducted by the manufacturers are inappropriate and, for the same reason, chooses not to compare LAP + AI with TRA + AI in an economic evaluation. ### conclusions LAP + AI and TRA + AI appear to be clinically more effective than AI monotherapy, but neither is cost-effective compared with AIs alone. It was not possible to compare LAP + AI with TRA + AI. Future research should include research into treating mBC in the HR+/HER2+ population who are not TRA (or LAP) naive and into comparing the clinical effectiveness of AIs as monotherapy in patients with HER2+ and human epidermal growth factor 2-negative breast cancer. ### funding The National Institute for Health Research Technology Assessment programme.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22152751/"}

In limited comparative trials, piperacillin/tazobactam demonstrated equivalent or better efficacy than standard comparator regimens in these infections. piperacillin/tazobactam in combination with an aminoglycoside was effective in the empirical treatment of fever in patients with neutropenia and compared favourably with ceftazidime in combination with an aminoglycoside, although second-line therapy with a glycopeptide antibiotic may be indicated in unresponsive episodes.

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype primarily seen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals with low CD4(+) cell counts and elevated HIV viral loads. It has always been associated with human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) and in 80% of cases has also been associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Less commonly, PEL has presented in patients with advanced age and other conditions associated with an altered immunity, including malignancy, liver cirrhosis, and immunosuppressive medications. It is a tumor of B-cell lineage; however, it shows a \"null\" phenotype, rarely expressing pan-B cell surface antigens. It will usually express CD45, CD30, CD38, CD138, and MUM1 and is characterized by lymphomatous effusions in body cavities but not lymphadenopathy. It is an aggressive lymphoma, with an average median survival of\u00a0< 1 year. HHV-8-associated large B-cell lymphoma (HHV-8-LBL) is a second variant of PEL that is both solid and extracavitary. It has immunoblastic and/or anaplastic morphologic features and a distinct immunohistochemical staining pattern. It could also have a different clinical presentation than that of classic PEL. ### Materials And Methods We describe the case of a 57-year-old HIV-infected man who presented with a slow-growing and asymptomatic abdominal mass. Examination of an excisional biopsy specimen showed malignant large cells with prominent cytoplasm that were positive for pan-B cell antigen CD20, HHV-8, and EBV and negative for CD138, CD10, BCL-6, CD3, and CD30. The Ki-67 labeling index was 90%. The diagnosis was stage IIIA HHV-8-LBL , and he was treated with 6 cycles of R-EPOCH ( rituximab , etoposide , vincristine , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , and prednisone ) infusion chemotherapy . At 12 months after treatment, he was in complete remission. We also performed a Medline and Embase search to better understand the clinical findings of our patient and the unique attributes of HHV-8-LBL. Focusing our search on English language studies, we identified 83 cases of HHV-8-LBL without an effusion component. We compared these 83 cases with 118 reported cases of classic PEL. ### results The median age of the patients with HHV-8-LBL was 41 years (range, 24-77), and 96% of the cases were associated with HIV. The median age of the patients with classic PEL was 41 years (range, 26-86), and 96% of the cases were associated with HIV. Of those with HHV-8-LBL, 31 of 61 (51%) had a pre-existing diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 47 of 63 (75%) were coinfected with EBV. In contrast, 69 of 96 patients (72%) with classic PEL had a pre-existing AIDS diagnosis and 40 of 49 (82%) were coinfected with EBV. The mean CD4(+) count of the HHV-8-LBL patients was 256 cells/\u03bcL (range, 18-1126 cells/\u03bcL) compared with 139 cells/\u03bcL (range, 2-557 cells/\u03bcL) in the classic PEL patients. The median survival time for both groups was similar at 5.5 months (range, 25 days to\u00a0\u2265 25 months) for patients with HHV-8-LBL and 4 months (range, 2 days to\u00a0\u2265 113 months) for those with classic PEL. More patients with HHV-8-LBL were alive at the last follow-up point (59% vs. 18%). The percentage of patients achieving complete remission was 54% (30 of 56) and 36% (32 of 89) for HHV-8-LBL and classic PEL, respectively. ### conclusion Our patient's high CD4(+) cell count, the lack of a pre-existing AIDS diagnosis, and the excellent response to chemotherapy highlights that HHV-8-LBL might have distinct clinical features and possibly a better response to chemotherapy than classic PEL. HHV-8-LBL should be included in the differential diagnosis of HIV patients with solid lesions. It is essential that patients' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV clinical status and HIV viral load at the diagnosis of PEL and HHV-8-LBL be reported and that the reported clinical results include longer term follow-up data. Only then will a more complete clinical picture of this little-appreciated and little-understood PEL variant be defined.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27234438/"}

Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by poor treatment efficacy and short survival time. Clinical trials have shown that the combination of chemotherapy with thermotherapy exhibits strong efficacy. We performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of gemcitabine plus cisplatin ( GP ) and paclitaxel plus cisplatin ( TP ) combined with thermotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC , as well as to provide reference for clinical practice and future research . ### methods We searched international (Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMBASE) and Chinese (CBM, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang) databases for relevant articles and imported other retrievable sources, such as tracing-related references. We also corresponded with other authors to obtain certain inaccessible information. Data from all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) were collected to compare GP or TP thermochemotherapy with GP or TP chemotherapy alone. The quality of the included studies was assessed by adequate outcome-based standards and clinical circumstances. The meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.1. ### results Fifteen RCTs involving 952 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the thermochemotherapy group had higher rates of improvement in quality of life (OR=3.84, 95%CI: 2.61-5.64), survival at 1 year (HR=1.94, 95%CI: 1.21-3.12), and survival at 2 years (HR=2.05, 95%CI: 1.18-3.58) compared with the chemotherapy group, with the differences between them being significant. However, these groups did not differ in other indicators of treatment effectiveness, such as myelosuppression, alimentary canal reactions, hepatic lesions, and diarrhea. ### conclusions Compared with chemotherapy alone, thermochemotherapy can improve survival rates and curative effects, ameliorate symptoms, and enhance the quality of life of patients with advanced NSCLC, and it has an acceptable safety profile. The results of this meta-analysis warrant further investigation with a larger sample size and using a high-quality RCT design.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22901992/"}

However, newer agents such as gemcitabine and paclitaxel appear to have superior single agent activity and are more easily tolerated in comparison to the older platinum compounds. Therefore , we conducted this phase II study to evaluate the activity and toxicity of the combination paclitaxel and gemcitabine in advanced NSCLC . gemcitabine was given at 1,000 mg/m(2) intravenously over 30 min followed by paclitaxel at 110 mg/m(2) intravenously over 1 h on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days for a maximum of 6 cycles. Between April 1998 and June 1999, 40 of 42 patients entered were eligible and received chemotherapy. Data was available on 39 patients. Toxicities included Grade 3/4 neutropenia in 43% of patients, while thrombocytopenia (13%) and anemia (7%) were less frequent. Five (12.5%) patients developed neutropenic fever. Four (10%) patients developed bilateral interstitial shadows with hypoxia suggestive of a drug-induced pneumonitis. There were 4 treatment-related deaths (1 from pneumonitis, 3 from neutropenic complications). Five patients were not evaluable due to early death. Therefore, 34 patients were evaluable with 12 (35.3%) achieving a partial remission and 1 achieving a complete remission for an overall response rate of 38.2% (32.5% on an intention-to-treat basis).

Swelling behavior of cylindrical gels showed that, irrespective of the hydrated or dehydrated state of the gel, the rate of swelling was the highest in water. When the gels were exposed to water, they first showed a swelling phase in which their weight increased 3 and 30 times for hydrated and dehydrated gels, respectively, due to absorption of water, followed by a dissolution phase.

The release behavior of both theophylline and sulfamethoxazole drugs from BLG gels was achieved in a time window ranging from 6 to 24 h. The drug release depended mainly on the solubility of the drugs and the physical state of the gel (hydrated or dry form).

Recurrent acute otitis media occurs during the first several years of life in approximately 20 to 30% of the pediatric population. A clinical challenge closely related to recurrent otitis media is persistent otitis media, manifested by persistence during antimicrobial therapy of symptoms and signs of middle ear infection (treatment failure) and/or relapse of acute otitis media within 1 month of completion of antibiotic therapy. Recurrent and persistent otitis media infections are early childhood problems with identifiable risk factors. Differentiation of these infections from otitis media with effusion is important in avoiding misdiagnosis and overtreatment with antibiotics. The predominant pathogens of recurrent and persistent acute otitis media are antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae. A working group convened by the Centers for Disease Control recommended three antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent and persistent acute otitis media : ( 1 ) amoxicillin/clavulanate in combination with amoxicillin ( high dose amoxicillin regimen , 80 to 90 mg/kg/day ) ; ( 2 ) cefuroxime axetil ( standard dose , 30 mg/kg/day ) ; and ( 3 ) ceftriaxone ( possibly requiring up to three injections to optimize clinical success ) . Other antibiotics were considered suboptimal or had accumulated insufficient data upon which to base a judgment. Conclusions. Optimal management of recurrent and persistent acute otitis media is a clinical challenge. Accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media is the first step in optimal management. Selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy should take into account the major pathogens (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) and the occurrence of antibiotic resistance.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11001126/"}

All drugs were given intravenously at the start of anesthesia. ### Main Outcome Measures Rates of major wound infections, minor wound infections, other wound problems, and other infective complications. The acquisition and administrative costs of the drugs used and the costs of the infective complications were measured. ### results A Total of 1070 patients were entered into the study. Major wound infections occurred in 21 patients (2.0%). Twenty-five patients (2.3%) developed a minor wound infection. Other infective complications developed in 107 patients. There were significantly fewer minor wound infections in the ceftriaxone-treated group as compared with the other 2 groups. There was no differences in the frequency of major wound infections, other wound problems, or other infective complications. The acquisition costs of cefotaxime and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid were less than those of ceftriaxone. The estimated cost of treating the infective complications in the group of patients who received ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid ($128,039) was greater than the cost associated with the groups being treated with cefotaxime ($91,243) or ceftriaxone ($96,095). ### conclusions The study indicates that each of the 3 regimens was associated with highly satisfactory control of postoperative infective complications after abdominal surgery. On the basis of the estimated costs of infective complications , cefotaxime and ceftriaxone appear equally effective for the prevention of infective complications after abdominal surgery . Acquisition costs for cefotaxime were lower and it is recommended as the preferred agent on this basis.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8678775/"}

Here, we report that a combinational approach consisting of drugs designed for targeting lipid metabolism, lovastatin (an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, HMGCR) and troglitazone (an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, PPAR\u03b3), exhibits anti-proliferation in cell culture systems and leads to tumor regression in a mouse xenograft model. The composition contains a sub-lethal concentration of both drugs and exhibits low toxicity to certain types of normal cells. Our results support a hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of the combination is partly through a cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, as evidenced by the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29932104/"}

Antimicrobial agents investigated (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, rifampin, amikacin, gentamicin, enrofloxacin, vancomycin, imipenem, and doxycycline) were selected based on in vitro activity and frequency of use in foals or people infected with R. equi.

The addition of high-dose cytarabine to the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has significantly prolonged survival of patients, but relapses are common and are normally associated with increased resistance. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for cytarabine resistance, and to create a tool for drug discovery investigations, we established a unique and molecularly reproducible cytarabine resistant model from the Z138 MCL cell line. ### methods Effects of different substances on cytarabine-sensitive and resistant cells were evaluated by assessment of cell proliferation using [methyl-14C]-thymidine incorporation and molecular changes were investigated by protein and gene expression analyses. ### results Gene expression profiling revealed that major transcriptional changes occur during the initial phase of adaptation to cellular growth in cytarabine containing media, and only few key genes, including SPIB, are deregulated upon the later development of resistance. Resistance was shown to be mediated by down-regulation of the deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) protein, responsible for activation of nucleoside analogue prodrugs. This key event, emphasized by cross-resistance to other nucleoside analogues, did not only effect resistance but also levels of SPIB and NF-\u03baB, as assessed through forced overexpression in resistant cells. Thus, for the first time we show that regulation of drug resistance through prevention of conversion of pro-drug into active drug are closely linked to increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in MCL. Using drug libraries, we identify several substances with growth reducing effect on cytarabine resistant cells. We further hypothesized that co-treatment with bortezomib could prevent resistance development. This was confirmed and show that the dCK levels are retained upon co-treatment , indicating a clinical use for bortezomib treatment in combination with cytarabine to avoid development of resistance . The possibility to predict cytarabine resistance in diagnostic samples was assessed, but analysis show that a majority of patients have moderate to high expression of dCK at diagnosis, corresponding well to the initial clinical response to cytarabine treatment. ### conclusion We show that cytarabine resistance potentially can be avoided or at least delayed through co-treatment with bortezomib, and that down-regulation of dCK and up-regulation of SPIB and NF-\u03baB are the main molecular events driving cytarabine resistance development.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29695239/"}

Cell surface proteins induced by fludarabine and cladribine may be targets for therapeutic antibodies .", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22839105/"}

Here we report on two cases of metastatic colorectal cancer in which the patients suffered from intestinal perforation after chemotherapy with bevacizumab. For the first case, a 47 year-old man had rectal cancer with concurrent liver and lung metastasis. He underwent chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and bevacizumab. Fever and abdominal pain developed seven days later, and rectal perforation was identified upon exploration 13 days later.

The Ondansetron and Granisetron Emesis Study Group. This is the first international, multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, parallel group study to directly compare the efficacy and safety profile of a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (8 or 32 mg) with granisetron (3 mg) in the control of cisplatin-induced acute emesis. A total of 496 patients were randomised to receive one of three anti-emetic treatments prior to cisplatin chemotherapy (> or = 50 mg/m2). Of these, 165 and 162 patients received 8 and 32 mg of ondansetron, respectively, and 169 patients received 3 mg of granisetron. Complete control of emesis (0 emetic episodes) over 24 h was reported in 59% of patients in the 8-mg ondansetron group, 51% of patients in the 32-mg ondansetron group and 56% of patients in the granisetron group. Complete or major control (< or = 2 emetic episodes) was achieved in 76 and 74% of patients in the 8- and 32-mg ondansetron group, respectively, compared with 78% of patients in the granisetron group.

There were no significant differences between the treatment groups when global satisfaction scores were compared. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess any interaction between treatments and prognostic factors (age, gender, alcohol use, cisplatin dose or concomitant chemotherapy) on complete or major response, but there was no evidence of interaction for any factor. All three anti-emetic treatments were well tolerated and no severe or unexpected drug-related adverse events were observed with ondansetron or granisetron. Headache, the most reported drug-related adverse event for all three treatment groups, occurred in 9% of all patients. In summary, no significant difference was observed between any of the treatment groups with respect to emesis, nausea or drug-related adverse events.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8265095/"}

Preliminary data on the perioperative use of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing craniotomy for brain tumor under general anaesthesia indicate that the intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine is opioid-sparing, results in less need for antihypertensive medication, and may offer greater hemodynamic stability at incision and emergence. Dexmedetomidine, alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist used as adjuvant to anaesthetic agents. Relatively recent studies have shown that dexmedetomidine is able to decrease circulating plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentration in approximately 50 % , decreases brain blood flow by directly acting on post-synaptic alpha 2 receptors , decreases CSF pressure without ischemic suffering and effectively decrease brain metabolism and intracranial pressure and also , able to decrease injury caused by focal ischemia . ### purpose This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was designed to assess the perioperative effect of intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine in patients with supratentorial tumors undergoing craniotomy under general anaesthesia. ### methods Forty patients with CT- scanning proof of supratentorial tumors. The patients were classified equally into 2 groups (twenty patients in each group). Group A:--The dexmedetomidine was given as a bolus dose of 1 microg/kg in 20 minutes before induction of anaesthesia, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.4 microg/kg/hr. The infusion was discontinued when surgery ended. Group B:--The patients received similar volumes of saline. ### results The heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure, decreased in patients of group A (dexmedetomidine group) more than group B (placebo group) with significant statistical difference between the two groups (P-value <0.05). No significant statistical difference between the two groups regarding the central venous pressure and arterial partial pressure of Carbon Dioxide (P-value >0.05). The intraoperative end-tidal sevoflurane (%) in patients of group A less than in patients of group B (P-value <0.05).The intracranial pressure decreased in patients of Group A more than group B (P-value <0.05). The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) improved in patients of group A and deteriorated in patients of Group B with significant statistical difference between the two groups (P-value <0.05). The total fentanyl requirements from induction to extubation of patients increased in patients of group B more than in patients of group A (P-value <0.05). The total postoperative patients' requirements for antiemetic drugs within the 2 hours after extubation decreased in patients of group A more than group B (P-value <0.05). The postoperative duration from the end of surgery to extubation decreased significantly in patients of group A more than group B (P-value <0.05). The total urine output during the duration from drug administration to extubation of patients increased in patients of group A more than group B (P-value <0.05). ### conclusions Continuous intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine during craniotomy for supratentorial tumors under general anaesthesia maintained the haemodynamic stability, reduced sevoflurane and fentanyl requirements, decreased intracranial pressure, and improved significantly the outcomes.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22428485/"}
