Recent clinical work has questioned the safety of a combined therapy of oral quinidine and intravenous verapamil , because some patients were reported to react with severe hypotension probably due to drug interactions with vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors . In order to obtain further quantitative information on the underlying mechanism, we used the radioligands (3H)-prazosin and (3H)-yohimbine to perform binding studies on intact cells, with predominantly alpha-1 (isolated myocytes) or alpha-2 subtypes (human platelets) of adrenergic receptors. Our studies confirm that both verapamil and quinidine possess a distinct alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking activity and do not discriminate between the alpha-1 and alpha-2 subtype (Ki-values were between 0.24-0.28 mumol/l for alpha-1 receptors and 0.49-0.50 mumol/l for alpha-2 receptors). Their interaction was competitive and in the presence of both drugs inhibition of radioligand binding was additive. The alpha-adrenergic blockade by verapamil was stereospecific as D-verapamil increased the dissociation constant of the radioligand to a much lesser degree than L-verapamil (Ki = 1.67 +/- 0.29 mumol/l for D-verapamil). The calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, a 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative, did not show any competition up to concentrations of 10 mumol/l. Our results thus give evidence that verapamil and quinidine have already at therapeutic blood levels significant alpha-adrenergic blocking activities which may be of clinical interest.

In the present studies, we assessed the effect of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and determined whether the functional activity of L-type calcium channels is altered after repeated cocaine administration. Rats were administered daily intraperitoneal injections of either flunarizine (40 mg/kg), diltiazem (40 mg/kg) or cocaine (20 mg/kg) and the combination of the CCBs and cocaine for 30 days. Motor activities were monitored on Day 1, and every 6th day during the 30-day treatment period. Daily cocaine administration produced increased locomotor activity. Maximal augmentation of behavioral response to repeated cocaine administration was observed on Day 18. Flunarizine pretreatment abolished the augmented behavioral response to repeated cocaine administration while diltiazem was less effective . Measurement of tissue monoamine levels on Day 18 revealed cocaine-induced increases in DA and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens. By contrast to behavioral response, diltiazem was more effective in attenuating increases in monoamine levels than flunarizine. Cocaine administration for 18 days produced increases in calcium uptake in synaptosomes prepared from the nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex. Increases in calcium uptake were abolished by flunarizine and diltiazem pretreatment. Taken together, the augmented cocaine-induced behavioral response on Day 18 may be due to increased calcium uptake in the nucleus accumbens leading to increased dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) release. flunarizine and diltiazem attenuated the behavioral response by decreasing calcium uptake and decreasing neurochemical release.", "source": null, "doc_id": "01488860ce8a1f2064d637382e61dcc7"}

This review establishes the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the major nucleoside analogues with cytotoxic activity. cytarabine, pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine and gemcitabine are all prodrugs whose plasma pharmacokinetics do not fully reflect their therapeutic activity; after cellular uptake, these compounds undergo phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase before their incorporation into DNA results in cell death. cytarabine is principally active in the S phase of the cell cycle and is most toxic to replicating cells, whereas pentostatin, fludarabine and cladribine are incorporated into DNA during the process in which strand breaks are repaired and are therefore cytotoxic to slowly replicating cells (although the action of pentostatin results from its inhibition of adenosine deaminase). gemcitabine is unusual in being highly metabolised in solid tumour cells. The cytotoxic activity of pentostatin, fludarabine and cladribine against the clonal cells of lymphoproliferative disorders is accompanied by damage to normal lymphoid cells, which results in significant and long-lasting immunosuppression. Useful interactions between nucleoside analogues have been defined. Cells that are primed by exposure to fludarabine or cladribine exhibit enhanced accumulation of cytarabine triphosphate (the cytotoxic nucleotide of cytarabine) and an improved therapeutic effect against acute myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia can be achieved by clinical schedules that exploit this effect. Combinations of alkylating agents and fludarabine or cladribine are also synergistic in producing significantly enhanced activity against refractory lymphoid malignancies , but at the cost of increased haematological toxicity . Developments in the clinical administration of gemcitabine are concentrating on efforts to extend the duration of exposure to the drug as a means of counteracting its rapid catabolism in the circulation. Future developments with this group of agents will further explore the use of fludarabine-based combination therapies to produce a transient period of myelosuppression and immunosuppression that is sufficient to permit the engraftment of allogeneic haemopoietic stem cells and also exploit the immunological benefits of graft-versus-tumour reactions.

Of 4674 patients given chemotherapy annually, 36% were given it by clinical oncologists, 30% by medical oncologists, 27% by respiratory physicians, and 7% by general physicians. In all, 34 regimens were reported with 151 different combinations of dose and schedule. In 2311 good prognosis patients, 23 regimens were used, the commonest being ACE (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide), ICbE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide), CAV (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine), CbE (carboplatin, etoposide), and PE (cisplatin, etoposide). In 1517 poor prognosis patients , 21 regimens were used , the commonest being CAV , EV ( etoposide , vincristine ) , CbE , CAV alternating with PE , and oral etoposide . 452 patients were treated regardless of prognosis and for 219 no prognostic criteria were specified. The remaining 175 were given second-line chemotherapy or were given regimens chosen to avoid toxicity or because of intercurrent disease or other reasons. The main reasons affecting choice of regimen were routine local practice, patients' convenience, quality of life considerations, trial results and cost. The results show wide variation in routine practice and will be useful in reporting and planning clinical trials and in deciding on local treatment policies.", "source": null, "doc_id": "26176aad604a52fd2bb4bcc904127ead"}

Given the underrepresentation of older patients in registration trials for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), data to support the use of any particular systemic therapy over others, based on age, is limited. This is further complicated by clinical trials not commonly reporting adverse events by age. Thus, recommendations on treatment of older patients with mRCC are generally extrapolated from data on younger patients enrolled in these trials, which may not be ideal as many older patients are frail, have age-related organ dysfunction, or have multiple medical co-morbidities. In the last decade, the treatment landscape for mRCC has drastically changed with the approval of more than ten targeted therapies, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, treatment selection and sequencing of treatments can be especially challenging for clinicians. We begin this review by analyzing the available efficacy and toxicity data of these treatments in younger and older patients. We also discuss a network meta-analysis that compares the efficacy of these agents in older patients with mRCC.

Dysregulation of this pathway occurs in more than one-third of all malignancies, a process that has fostered the development of targeted Map kinase pathway inhibitors. Cutaneous melanomas, which arise from skin melanocytes, are the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Mutations that activate the Map kinase pathway occur in more than 90% of these melanomas. This has led to the development of the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib or vemurafenib and cobimetanib for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutant melanomas. dabrafenib and vemurafenib target V600E/K BRAF mutants while trametinib and cobimetanib target MEK1/2. The latter two agents bind to MEK1/2 at a site that is adjacent to, but separate from, the ATP-binding site and are therefore classified as type III allosteric protein kinase inhibitors. These agents form a hydrogen bond with a conserved β3-lysine and they make numerous hydrophobic contacts with residues within the αC-helix, the β5 strand, and within the activation segment, regions of the protein kinase domain that exhibit greater diversity than those found within the ATP-binding site. One advantage of such allosteric inhibitors is that they do not have to compete with millimolar concentrations of cellular ATP, which most FDA-approved small molecule competitive inhibitors such as imatinib must do. Owing to the wide spread activation of this pathway in numerous neoplasms , trametinib and cobimetinib are being studied in combination with other targeted and cytotoxic drugs in a variety of clinical situations .

We asked whether the gene expression of 3D spheroids would reveal mechanisms of resistance. To address this, we measured gene expression of three mesothelioma cell lines, M28, REN and VAMT, grown as 2D monolayers and 3D spheroids. A total of 209 genes were differentially expressed in common by the three cell lines in 3D (138 upregulated and 71 downregulated), although a clear resistance pathway was not apparent. We then compared the list of 3D genes with two publicly available datasets of gene expression of 56 pleural mesotheliomas compared to normal tissues. Interestingly, only three genes were increased in both 3D spheroids and human tumors: argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), annexin A4 (ANXA4) and major vault protein (MVP); of these, ASS1 was the only consistently upregulated of the three genes by qRT-PCR. To measure ASS1 protein expression, we stained 2 sets of tissue microarrays (TMA): one with 88 pleural mesothelioma samples and the other with additional 88 pleural mesotheliomas paired with matched normal tissues. Of the 176 tumors represented on the two TMAs, ASS1 was expressed in 87 (50%; staining greater than 1 up to 3+).

Previous reports revealed that nicotine activates the locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic (NAergic) system and this mechanism may underlie its beta-adrenoceptor sensitive LLP effects. clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is also known to activate the LC. Interactions between nicotine and clozapine are of interest because of the prevalence of smoking in patients with schizophrenia and increasing interest in the use of nicotinic receptor ligands as cognitive enhancers. Rats were subchronically primed with nicotine , clozapine or saline . Twenty-one to twenty-eight days later, the effects of the nicotine, clozapine or saline challenge on the evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) at the MPP-DG monosynaptic pathway were recorded as a measure of LLP. We confirmed the hypothesis that a challenge dose of either nicotine or clozapine induces LLP exclusively in nicotine- and clozapine-primed rats, and not in saline-primed rats, thus indicating a cross-priming effect. Moreover, unilateral suppression of LC using lidocaine abolished the LLP induced by nicotine in clozapine-primed rats. Furthermore, systemic treatment with clonidine (an α2 adrenoceptor agonist that reduces NAergic activity via autoreceptors) prior to the challenge doses blocked the nicotine/clozapine-induced LLP in nicotine- and clozapine-primed rats. These findings may add to understanding of the cognitive enhancing effects of nicotine.", "source": null, "doc_id": "e85037de90f9d9227fd3c680bd0ce306"}

Hypertensive crises are further defined as either hypertensive emergencies or urgencies, depending on the degree of blood pressure elevation and presence of end-organ damage.

On the first post-operative day she became septic due to a surgical wound infection. Despite being treated according to the therapeutic protocols for sepsis, no clinical improvement was noticed and further assessment revealed an underlying immunodeficiency. Considering the underlying immunodeficiency and to that point poor clinical response, an antifungal agent was added to the antibiotic regiment. Following discontinuation of multiple antifungal agents due to adverse effects, posaconazole was administered. posaconazole oral intake was followed by episodes of bradycardia and QT interval prolongation. The patient suffered continuous incidents of cardiac arrest due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades des pointes) that degenerated to lethal ventricular fibrillation. posaconazole was immediately discontinued and a temporary pacemaker was installed. The patient finally recovered without any neurological deficit, and was discharged in a good clinical status. ### conclusions Close cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases where posaconazole administration is combined with coexisting risk factors, as they may lead to severe ECG abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias such as long QT interval syndrome and torsades de pointes. posaconazole interactions with medications metabolized via the CYP3A4 pathway should be considered an additional risk factor for lethal cardiac incidents.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27125217/", "doc_id": "afb487e5f3a9ba9b35526d05826560e6"}

Lower, clinically relevant dose of decitabine also resulted in global demethylation including the CpG island shores and induced XPC in 50% of cell lines. decitabine followed by DNA-damaging carboplatin treatment led to significantly higher XPC expression in 75% of melanoma cell lines tested. Combined sequential treatment also resulted in a greater apoptotic response in 75% of cell lines compared to carboplatin alone, and significantly slowed cell proliferation, with some melanoma cell lines going into senescence.

There is an increasing use and variety of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (beta-blockers) available for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Recent comparative studies suggest that atenolol ( 200 mg daily ) , metoprolol ( 200 mg daily ) ; acebutolol ( 400 mg daily ) , oxprenolol ( 160 mg daily ) , nadolol ( 80 mg daily ) and timolol ( 20 mg daily ) produce a beneficial clinical response equal to that seen with propranolol ( 160 mg daily ) . Most beta-blockers reduce resting heart rate by approximately 25 to 30 beats/min, although a lesser reduction is seen with those possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as oxprenolol and pindolol. While earlier studies employing large doses of intravenous propranolol concluded that beta-blockade reduced myocardial contractility, more recent non-invasive studies suggest that the predominant cardiac effect is on heart rate. In patients with cardiac failure, beta-blockers may, however, produce a profound fall in cardiac output. Nevertheless, in combination with digoxin they may be useful in controlling the atrial fibrillation of thyrocardiac disease. beta-Blockers improve nervousness and tremor (although to a lesser extent with cardioselective agents) and severe myopathy, and they also reduce the frequency of paralysis in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. There is often subjective improvement in sweating but usually no major effect on eye signs. Recent studies show a 10% reduction in oxygen consumption/basal metabolic rate with long term oral use of selective or nonselective beta-blockers. In addition, many agents (propranolol, metoprolol, nadolol and sotalol but not acebutolol, atenolol or oxprenolol) reduce circulating tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentration by between 10 and 40%, although the clinical significance of this effect (if any) is not established. beta-Blockers may also have endocrinological effects on gastrin, cyclic AMP, catecholamines and other hormone levels. Given in adequate dosage, propranolol has been shown to control thyrotoxic hypercalcaemia. Minor side effects (nausea, headaches, tiredness, etc.) are quite common but overall beta-blockers are well tolerated by the thyrotoxic patient. The major use of these drugs is in symptomatic control while awaiting definitive diagnosis or treatment. As an adjunct to antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine, beta-blockers will produce a satisfactory clinical response in the weeks to months before these forms of therapy produce a euthyroid state. beta-Blockers are more convenient than antithyroid drugs in the control of patients receiving therapeutic radioiodine, in that continuous therapy and assessment of biochemical response is possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6144501/", "doc_id": "a3728ecff22176b9a5c91cf433c52ad7"}

Proof of concept in animal models. In the present work, we have evaluated the possibility of preventing liver carcinogenesis in rats at two stages of development. In the first series of experiments, we induced foci of altered hepatocytes, (FAH) which represent the first events in rodent liver carcinogenesis, using the chemical mutagens diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and acetylaminofluorene (AAF). In the second part of the work, we used repeated weekly injections of DEN only that gave rise to significant fibrosis at 11 weeks and the development of malignant tumours at 16 weeks. We chose to assess the chemopreventive effect of three different drugs : pioglitazone , lanreotide and S-trans-trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid ( FTS ) . pioglitazone (PGZ) is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg), itself a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, responsible for the modulation of a number of metabolic pathways, including cell differentiation, metabolism of lipids and inflammation. lanreotide (LAN) is a somatostatin analogue that has an inhibitory effect on the release of several hormones, such as growth hormone and serotonine. FTS is a specific antagonist of the protoocogene Ras, tested here based on the rationale that Ras is activated in many hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We showed that both PGZ and LAN were efficient in the first, pre-neoplastic model, by reducing the size of FAH, decreasing proliferation specifically in FAH by interacting with proteins of the cell cycle. We could also demonstrate that LAN increased apoptosis. In the second model, LAN was able to diminish the number of established HCC by decreasing proliferation, in parallel with an anti-fibrotic action. Furthermore, enhanced apoptosis and antiangiogenic effects were observed when LAN was given from the start of the carcinogenic induction by DEN. The cellular mechanisms leading to its effects warrant further investigations. FTS also strongly inhibited the appearance of FAH and HCC in the second model, through a complete inhibition of Ras activation and the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways. On the contrary, PGZ did not prevent the appearance of neoplastic lesions. For these reasons, we did not analyse further its mechanism of action in the second model. Altogether, the results we obtained demonstrate an activity of both LAN and FTS, at the early onset of liver carcinogenesis, and later on when advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC are induced. These anti-tumoural effects could be complementary and will be tested in combination in the future.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21563652/", "doc_id": "6f09f4aa6c650b00d751ef90c70bf1df"}

Generic statins could change the cost effectiveness of statin therapies in Spain, and more population groups could be included in the recommendations for reduction of cholesterol levels based on cost effectiveness. ### objectives The objectives of this study were: (i) to assess the cost effectiveness of available statins for the reduction of LDL-C levels in Spain in 2010, after the introduction of generics and reference prices; (ii) to assess the cost effectiveness of combination therapy using a statin plus cholestyramine or ezetimibe; and (iii) to estimate the mean cost per patient to achieve National Cholesterol Education Program (Adult Treatment Panel-III) therapeutic objectives. ### methods The following treatments were evaluated: rosuvastatin 5-20 mg/day; atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin 10-40 mg/day; lovastatin and fluvastatin 20-80 mg/day; and combination therapy with a statin plus either cholestyramine 12-24 g/day or ezetimibe 10 mg/day. The cost effectiveness was evaluated in terms of cost per percentage point reduction in LDL-C, comparing the annual treatment costs with the effectiveness in reducing LDL-C. Treatment costs included those for medications (2010 wholesale prices), control measures, and treatment of adverse drug effects. The effectiveness of statins was estimated by developing a meta-analysis of clinical trials published between 1993 and 2005 that met several inclusion criteria. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to assess the efficiency of individual statin and combination therapies in reducing LDL-C levels. ### results The effectiveness in terms of percentage reduction in LDL-C ranged from 19% for pravastatin 10 mg/day to 55% for atorvastatin 80 mg/day. Annual treatment costs ranged from Euro 189.7 for simvastatin 10 mg/day to Euro 759.3 for atorvastatin 80 mg/day. The cost-effectiveness ratios, in terms of cost per percentage point reduction in LDL-C, were: Euro 6 for simvastatin, Euro 10-12 for rosuvastatin, Euro 10 for lovastatin, Euro 13-16 for atorvastatin, Euro 13-14 for fluvastatin, and Euro 14-20 for pravastatin. Rosuvastatin + ezetimibe , simvastatin + ezetimibe , and atorvastatin + ezetimibe were the most cost-effective combination therapies for reducing LDL-C levels . rosuvastatin was the most cost-effective statin for achieving the LDL-C therapeutic goal in patients at high risk for CHD, with a mean cost per patient of Euro 516. simvastatin was the most cost-effective statin to achieve the LDL-C goal in patients with moderate or low CHD risk, with a cost per patient of Euro 217 and Euro 190, respectively. ### conclusion rosuvastatin should be the first-choice agent in patients with high CHD risk, while simvastatin should be the first choice in patients with moderate or low risk. The addition of ezetimibe to rosuvastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin should be the preferred combination therapies when greater LDL-C reductions are required.

We conclude that nadifloxacin and tosufloxacin are likely to be most effective against S. aureus, but fusidic acid is more suitable for the treatment of children.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9283995/", "doc_id": "5c88fa895583c022261c8290cb802c4e"}

The two nonapeptides arginine vasopressin and oxytocin are not only secreted from the neurohypophysis into the general circulation but are also released intracerebrally. Our recent research has focused on the release patterns and effects of oxytocin and vasopressin in brain areas, such as the septum and hypothalamus, that are thought to be involved in the regulation of (1) behavioural responses and (2) responses of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system (HNS) to stressor exposure in rats. The results demonstrate that combined physical and emotional stress (induced by exposure to forced swimming) selectively triggers the release of vasopressin within all brain areas under study but not into the general circulation. Under emotional stress conditions (induced by exposure to the 'social defeat' procedure), however, oxytocin rather than vasopressin release increased within the hypothalamus and septum. Experiments aimed at revealing the neuroendocrine and behavioural relevance of the local nonapeptide release provided evidence for an involvement of vasopressin in the regulation of HNS activity (within the hypothalamus) and, moreover, in acute stress-coping strategies, anxiety-related behaviour and learning and memory processes (within the septum). The observed dissociation between central and peripheral nonapeptide release not only supports the hypothesis that plasma vasopressin and oxytocin concentrations do not necessarily reflect central release patterns but also suggests vasopressin and oxytocin neurones are able to independently release their nonapeptide from different parts of their neuronal surface (e.g. from somata/dendrites vs. axon terminals). This remarkable regulatory capacity provides the basis for an differential involvement of vasopressin, and probably also oxytocin, in the co-ordination of neuroendocrine activity, emotionality and cognition at different brain levels to ensure an appropriate behavioural response of the organism to stressful stimuli.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10795914/", "doc_id": "5b3c9e4fed209076e7d197b42242c429"}

We compared patient-reported outcomes (PRO) during CRT in patients who had received induction chemotherapy versus those who did not. ### Patients And Methods We reviewed records of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who were treated with CRT between September 2009 and October 2014, and who had completed ≥ 4 PRO assessments during treatment. Clinician- and patient-reported toxicities were collected each week during treatment. We fit binomial generalized linear models to maximum toxicity scores across all patients' visits. ### results Of 123 patients with ≥ 4 PRO assessments, 87 (71%) patients reported a clinically meaningful PRO score of 3 or higher for diarrhea, and 91 (74%) patients reported a PRO score of ≥ 3 for urgency, during 1 or more weeks of treatment, corresponding to 'very frequent' or worse. Of 116 patients who had also completed ≥ 4 clinician-reported assessments for descriptive analysis, clinically significant diarrhea (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade ≥ 2) was reported in 9% of patients, and grade 2 proctitis and cystitis were reported in 20% and 4%, respectively. Eighty-four (68%) patients had undergone induction chemotherapy prior to CRT. Patients who received induction chemotherapy had 68% lower odds of experiencing significant urgency (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.95; P = .04), 76% lower odds of bleeding (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.1-0.62; P < .01), and 75% lower odds of tenesmus (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.6; P < .01) versus those treated with upfront CRT. ### conclusion Based on PROs, a high proportion of patients experienced clinically significant symptoms during pelvic CRT, with diarrhea and urgency being most commonly reported. This appears to be under-reported on clinician-reported assessments. Delivery of induction chemotherapy was associated with lower odds of experiencing urgency, bleeding, and tenesmus on PROs during subsequent CRT, with no significant impact on diarrhea and rectal pain.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104990/", "doc_id": "5c6c7ff9d0b179779cae4a24b94343f9"}

However , clindamycin possesses only one of the two mechanisms of lincomycin action , which is bacteriostatic , against Escherichia coli . The relative potency of action of a clindamycin-lincomycin combination against Staph. aureus is variable, and the effective ratio ranges between 5:1 and 9:1; the effective ratio against E. coli is fixed at 6:1 over a wide concentration range. This difference is attributed to differences in bioavailability and/or binding characteristics of the drugs for bioreceptors, as a consequence of structural modifications in the drug molecules, and to differences in modes of action in the respective organisms. Mixtures containing equipotent fractions of clindamycin and lincomycin show \"equivalence\" or \"indifference\" of effects on Staph. aureus. The combined action of the mixtures can be quantitatively predicted from the separate dose-response curves of either component drug alone. Therefore, it is concluded that clindamycin and lincomycin may bind to the same receptor site that is engaged in microbial protein synthesis to inhibit the generation of Staph. aureus. However, combinations of clindamycin and lincomycin are less active than the a priori equipotent concentration of either drug alone in their action against E. coli, demonstrating unequivocally an antagonism of effects. Furthermore, the degree of antagonism is dependent on the order of addition of the drugs, which is attributed to the possibility that clindamycin and lincomycin bind differently on active and allosteric loci of the same receptor site functionally engaged in protein synthesis in E. coli. A rational approach to the quantification and prediction of combined antibiotic action must, therefore, be based not only on the kinetics and mechanisms of action as well as on the dose-response relationship over a wide concentration range for the separate antibiotics but also on the strain and species of the test organism.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1102659/", "doc_id": "056c7e350cc7a5271279359bfcf3bc9d"}

H. pylori was detected by using a combination of smear, culture and tissue sections. ### results Complete pain relief occurred within 3 days in all patients and all ulcers were healed by the end of the therapy. The H. pylori clearance rate was 83.3% and the eradication rate was 73.3%. A minor side effect (metallic taste) was reported by only one patient (3.3%). ### conclusions Therapy with a combination of 60 mg lansoprazole and 800 mg clarithromycin is efficacious in the eradication of H. pylori and has the advantage of a low incidence of side effects and quick pain relief for patients with active ulcers.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8574739/", "doc_id": "6d21b8fb44aec53cfdf566e8d7e95b68"}

The median follow-up was 31.8 months (range, 6-144 months). Tumor size was between 1.5 and 14 cm (median: 8 cm). Eighty-five percent of patients had localized disease at presentation and 15% had metastatic disease. Local therapy was surgery alone in 16% of patients, surgery combined with radiotherapy in 42% and radiotherapy alone in 27%. All patients were treated with vincristine , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide and actinomycin-D , alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide every 3 weeks . In patients with localized disease at presentation, the 5-year event-free survival and overall survival were 59.7 and 64.5%, respectively. At univariate analysis, patients with tumor size ≥ 8 cm, high serum lactate dehydrogenase, metastasis at presentation, poor histological response to chemotherapy and positive surgical margin had significantly worse event-free survival. The significant predictors of worse overall survival at univariate analysis were tumor size 8 ≥ cm, high lactate dehydrogenase, metastasis at presentation, poor histological response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy only as local treatment and positive surgical margin. ### conclusions Prognostic factors were similar to primary osseous Ewing's sarcomas.

The combination of an anti-VEGF or an anti-EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody with chemotherapy has shown clinical activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. However, combining both anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR antibodies with chemotherapy in first-line treatment resulted in adverse outcomes. We assessed whether the combination of erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with bevacizumab could increase the efficacy of maintenance therapy in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. ### methods This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was undertaken in 49 centres in France, Austria, and Canada. Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years with histologically confirmed, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, WHO performance status 0-2, had received no previous therapy for metastatic disease, and had adequate organ function. Patients without disease progression after bevacizumab-based induction therapy were randomly assigned (1:1) by a minimisation technique to bevacizumab (7·5 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or bevacizumab plus erlotinib (150 mg once daily) as maintenance therapy until progression. All patients were stratified by centre, baseline performance status, age, and number of metastatic sites. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival on maintenance therapy analysed by intention to treat. We report the final analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00265824. ### findings Between Jan 1, 2007, and Oct 13, 2011, 700 eligible patients were enrolled; following induction treatment, patients without disease progression were randomly assigned to bevacizumab (n=228) or bevacizumab plus erlotinib (n=224). At the final analysis, median follow-up was 51·0 months (IQR 36·0-60·0) in the bevacizumab group and 48·3 months (31·5-61·0) in the bevacizumab plus erlotinib group. In the primary analysis (after 231 progression-free survival events), median progression-free survival from randomisation was 5·1 months (95% CI 4·1-5·9) in the bevacizumab plus erlotinib group compared with 6·0 months (4·6-7·9) in the bevacizumab group (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·79 [95% CI 0·60-1·06]; p=0·11; unstratified HR 0·76 [0·59-0·99]; p=0·043).

Infarct volume, hemorrhagic volume, immunoglobulin G leakage, and blood parameters were examined. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, immunohistochemistry for PARs was performed in brain sections. ICH volume was increased in the warfarin-pretreated group compared with the rivaroxaban-treated group. PAR-1, -2, -3, and -4 were widely expressed in the normal brain, and their levels were increased in the ischemic brain, especially in the peri-ischemic lesion. warfarin pretreatment enhanced the expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 in the peri-ischemic lesion, whereas rivaroxaban pretreatment did not. The present study shows a lower risk of brain hemorrhage in rivaroxaban-pretreated compared with warfarin-pretreated rats following tPA administration to the ischemic brain.

The use of artemisinin derivative-based combination therapy (ACT) such as artesunate plus amodiaquine is currently recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Fixed-dose combinations are more adapted to patients than regimens involving multiple tablets and improve treatment compliance. A fixed-dose combination of artesunate + amodiaquine ( ASAQ ) was recently developed . To assess the efficacy and safety of this new combination and to define its optimum dosage regimen (once or twice daily) in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, a multicentre clinical study was conducted. ### methods A multicentre, randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, parallel-group study was conducted in five African centers in Cameroon, Madagascar, Mali and Senegal from March to December 2006. Efficacy and safety of ASAQ were assessed compared to those of artemether + lumefantrine (AL). The WHO protocol with a 28-day follow-up for assessing the drug therapeutic efficacy was used. Patients suffering from uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were randomized to receive ASAQ orally once daily (ASAQ1), ASAQ twice daily (ASAQ2) or AL twice daily (AL) for three days. The primary outcome was PCR-corrected parasitological cure rate and clinical response. ### results Of 941 patients initially randomized and stratified into two age groups (<5 years, and >or=5 years), 936 (99.5%) were retained for the intent to treat (ITT) analysis, and 859 (91.3%) patients for the per protocol (PP) analysis. Among ITT population, up to D28, PCR-corrected adequate parasitological and clinical response rates were 95.2% in the ASAQ1 group, 94.9% in the ASAQ2 group and 95.5% in the AL group. Moreover, the cure rate evaluated among PP population was >or=98.5% in both ASAQ therapeutic arms. Therapeutic response rates did not display any significant differences between age groups or between one geographical site and another. Altogether, this demonstrates the non-inferiority of ASAQ1 regimen compared to both ASAQ2 and AL regimens. During follow-up mild and moderate adverse events including gastrointestinal and/or nervous disorders were reported in 29.3% of patients, with no difference between groups in the nature, frequency or intensity of adverse events. ### conclusion The non-inferiority of ASAQ compared with AL was demonstrated. The fixed-dose combination artesunate + amodiaquine (ASAQ) is safe and efficacious even in young children under 5 years of age. Whilst administration on a twice-a-day basis does not improve the efficacy of ASAQ significantly, a once-a-day intake of this new combination clearly appears as an effective and safe therapy in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria both in adults and children. Implications of such findings are of primary importance in terms of public health especially in African countries. As most national policies plan to strengthen malaria control to reach the elimination of this disease, anti-malarial drugs such as the artesunate + amodiaquine fixed-dose ACT will play a pivotal role in this process. ### Trial Registration The protocol was registered with the www.clinicaltrials.gov open clinical trial registry under the identifier number NCT00316329.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19505304/", "doc_id": "1d45a41a4087429135570126b747b54e"}

Other adverse reactions such as fever, debilitation, and alopecia were also observed. ### conclusions Very elderly patients (aged ≥80 years) with mCRPC are easy to be neglected and infrequently involved in clinical trials. Our study demonstrates that docetaxel chemotherapy plus prednisone is tolerable and effective among Chinese elderly patients (≥80 years) with mCRPC. docetaxel chemotherapy may be given under careful surveillance even in frail elderly patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33081478/", "doc_id": "0da184f3d08d17f701d7a11270065b3e"}

Twenty-one received norethisterone (5 mg twice a day on days 19 and 26) and 25 received tranexamic acid (1 g four times daily on days 1 to 4) for two cycles. ### Main Outcome Measures Menstrual blood loss was measured using the alkaline haematin method.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a hematological malignancy with unfavorable prognosis. Novel therapeutic approaches for treating the disease are aimed at the mechanisms regulating growth signals, cellular proliferation, and survival pathways of the malignant clones. bortezomib (Brt), a proteasome inhibitor with pleiotropic activities was shown to be active in MCL and is currently implemented in therapeutic combinations for this disease. Telomerase activity is essential for survival of malignant cells and as such is considered a valid therapeutic target. This study evaluated the effects of bortezomib on telomerase activity and its regulation in MCL cells in vitro and ex vivo. Our study shows that bortezomib exerts a cytotoxic effect in a dose dependent manner in two MCL cell lines, with differential sensitivity. While the IC50 for HBL-2 cells ranged between 2.5 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml during 24-72 h respectively, the IC50 for the NCEB cells was twice. bortezomib differentially inhibited telomerase activity (TA): in HBL-2 cells there was a decline of 20%-55% during 24-72 h respectively. However in NCEB cells the decline was much smaller, and did not exceed 25%. Inhibition of telomerase activity is shown to be operated by two separate mechanisms: reduction of the hTERT mRNA expression (controlled by the binding of transcription factors) and reduction in phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of hTERT by its kinases, AKT and PKCα. A decrease in telomerase activity was demonstrated also in mononuclear cells, isolated from three MCL patients following incubation of the cells in the presence of bortezomib for 24-72 h. In one patient the decrease in TA ranged between 17%-37% respectively, in the second patient between 63%-76% and in the third patient between 70-100% for 24-72 h respectively. The current study indicates that a combination of bortezomib and rapamycin, (an m-Tor pathway inhibitor used in MCL treatment) induced synergistic inhibition of telomerase activity. In HBL-2 cells, the combined treatment of bortezomib and rapamycin decreased TA by 80% compared to the expected value (40%) and for NCEB cells a similar trend was observed. In contrast, there was neither additive nor synergistic effect of this combination on cell proliferation. In the light of the crucial role of telomerase in cancer cells, it was important to characterize the possible relations between telomerase and bortezomib and to distinguish the biochemical mechanisms of its regulation and its interactions with other signal transduction inhibitors such as rapamycin.

To estimate the impact of therapy on hip fractures, costs, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), the analysis included women>or=65 years, treated with risedronate or alendronate and followed for 4 additional years. Country-specific data included population mortality, fracture costs, and annual drug costs, using a German social insurance perspective. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. A differential hip fracture relative risk reduction of 43% was applied to risedronate vs. alendronate. ### results The model predicted that treatment with risedronate would result in fewer hip fractures and more QALYs at a reduced cost (savings of euro278 per treated woman) compared to treatment with generic alendronate. Sensitivity analysis assuming 2 years of treatment and equivalence of effect after 1 year show cost savings as well (euro106 per treated woman). ### discussion Whereas previous economic evaluations involving bisphosphonates have mainly relied on efficacy data from noncomparative clinical trials, this study's strength is in the use of comparative effectiveness data from one data source. The magnitude of the cost savings observed were sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding treatment duration, therapy discontinuation and cost of generic alendronate. ### conclusions Based on \"real world\" data the analysis supports the first line use of risedronate for the treatment of osteoporotic women in Germany.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883401/", "doc_id": "60e477e5cd5aded203a0a848439207a0"}

Preoperative infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and concurrent radiation therapy (RT) followed by total mesorectal surgery is the current standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer (LAR). When compared with postoperative 5-FU-based chemoradiation, this strategy is associated with significantly lower rates of local relapse, lower toxicity and better compliance. capecitabine is a rationally designed oral prodrug that is converted into 5-FU by intracellular thymidine phosphorylase. Substitution of infusional 5-FU with capecitabine is an attractive option that provides a more convenient administration schedule and, possibly, increased efficacy. Indeed, incorporation of capecitabine in combined modality neoadjuvant therapy for LAR has been under intense investigation during the last 10 years. Phase I and II clinical trials showed that a regimen consisting of capecitabine 825mg/m(2) twice daily for 7 days/week continuous oral administration in combination with RT is an active and well tolerated regimen, thereby being the preferred concurrent regimen. The definitive demonstration that efficacy of capecitabine/RT is similar to 5-FU/RT has been provided by the NSABP-R-04 and the German Margit trials. One approach to improve outcomes in rectal cancer is to deliver a second RT-sensitizing drug with effective systemic activity. oxaliplatin and irinotecan are therefore good candidates. However , two phase III trials demonstrated that incorporation of oxaliplatin to capecitabine with RT did not improve early outcomes and , by contrast , increased toxicity . capecitabine has also been combined with irinotecan. This regimen showed encouraging results in phase I and II clinical trials, which led to an ongoing phase III clinical trial. New strategies with induction chemotherapy with or without chemoradiation prior to surgery are currently under investigation. Whether or not capecitabine has a role in this setting is being investigated in ongoing trials. Incorporation of agents directed towards new targets, such as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies or antiangiogenic agents, in combination preoperative regimens, is being hampered by results of early trials in which efficacy outcomes with cetuximab were poor and an excessive rate of surgical complications with bevacizumab was observed. The lack of improvements in efficacy with the addition of cetuximab or bevacizumab in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer led to concerns about further development of these agents in rectal cancer. The role of capecitabine in the postoperative adjuvant setting is the aim of the ongoing Dutch SCRIPT trial. The prediction of response associated with capecitabine has been based on expression of thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, as well as on gene expression arrays. All these procedures require further validation and should be considered as investigational. In conclusion, capecitabine can safely and effectively replace intravenous continuous infusion of 5-FU in the preoperative chemoradiation setting for rectal cancer management. The addition of other new antineoplastic agents to a fluoropyrimidine-based regimen remains investigational.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22621694/", "doc_id": "5d8e94d769dadafed1e67a36606f7721"}

Nevertheless, the adoption of lipid rescue therapy by Chinese practitioners remains unknown. We, therefore, evaluated the current approaches to treat LAST and the use of lipid rescue therapy among anesthesiologists in China. ### methods In September 2013, a 23-question survey on regional anesthesia practice and availability of lipid emulsions was sent by e-mail to directors or designated individuals at 41 academic anesthesiology departments listed by the orthopedic anesthesia group of the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology. ### results Responses were received from 36 of the 41 (88 %) anesthesiology departments. To simplify the analysis, responses were divided into two groups according to the annual percentage of patients who received regional anesthesia (RA) for orthopedic anesthesia: 14 departments (39%) with high-utilization (≥ 50%) and 22 departments (61%) low-utilization (<50%) of RA. Ropivacaine and bupivacaine were the common drugs used for RA , which were independent of RA utilization . Interestingly, ultrasound-guided techniques were much more frequently used in low-utilization institutions than in high-utilization institutions (P = 0.025). Lipid emulsion was readily available in 8 of the 36 (22%) responding institutions, with 7 of the other 28 (25%) institutions planning to stock lipid emulsion. No differences in lipid availability and storage plans were observed between high- and low-utilization institutions. Lipid resuscitation was performed in five of the eight departments that had lipid emulsion. Eleven patients were successfully resuscitated and one was not. ### conclusion Lipid emulsion is not widely available in China to treat LAST resulted from RA for orthopedic patients.

We also included trials where both eyes from one participant received different treatments. ### Data Collection And Analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.Two authors independently reviewed all the titles and abstracts identified from the electronic and manual searches against the inclusion criteria. Our primary outcome was change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between baseline and one year. Secondary outcomes included change in central macular thickness (CMT), economic data and quality of life. We considered adverse effects including intraocular inflammation, raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and development of cataract. ### Main Results There were eight RCTs (703 participants, 817 eyes) that met our inclusion criteria with only three studies reporting outcomes at one year. The studies took place in Iran (3), USA (2), Brazil (1), Czech Republic (1) and South Korea (1). Seven studies used the unlicensed anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab and one study used licensed ranibizumab. The study that used licensed ranibizumab had a unique design compared with the other studies in that included eyes had persisting DMO after anti-VEGF monotherapy and received three monthly doses of ranibizumab prior to allocation. The anti-VEGF agent was combined with intravitreal triamcinolone in six studies and with an intravitreal dexamethasone implant in two studies. The comparator group was anti-VEGF alone in all studies; two studies had an additional steroid monotherapy arm, another study had an additional macular laser photocoagulation arm. Whilst we judged these studies to be at low risk of bias for most domains, at least one domain was at unclear risk in all studies.When comparing anti-VEGF/steroid with anti-VEGF monotherapy as primary therapy for DMO, we found no meaningful clinical difference in change in BCVA (mean difference (MD) -2.29 visual acuity (VA) letters, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.03 to 1.45; 3 RCTs; 188 eyes; low-certainty evidence) or change in CMT (MD 0.20 μm, 95% CI -37.14 to 37.53; 3 RCTs; 188 eyes; low-certainty evidence) at one year. There was very low-certainty evidence on intraocular inflammation from 8 studies, with one event in the anti-VEGF/steroid group (313 eyes) and two events in the anti-VEGF group (322 eyes). There was a greater risk of raised IOP (Peto odds ratio (OR) 8.13, 95% CI 4.67 to 14.16; 635 eyes; 8 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) and development of cataract (Peto OR 7.49, 95% CI 2.87 to 19.60; 635 eyes; 8 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) in eyes receiving anti-VEGF/steroid compared with anti-VEGF monotherapy. There was low-certainty evidence from one study of an increased risk of systemic adverse events in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the anti-VEGF alone group (Peto OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.86; 103 eyes).One study compared anti-VEGF/steroid versus macular laser therapy. At one year investigators did not report a meaningful difference between the groups in change in BCVA (MD 4.00 VA letters 95% CI -2.70 to 10.70; 80 eyes; low-certainty evidence) or change in CMT (MD -16.00 μm, 95% CI -68.93 to 36.93; 80 eyes; low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence suggesting an increased risk of cataract in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the macular laser group (Peto OR 4.58, 95% 0.99 to 21.10, 100 eyes) and an increased risk of elevated IOP in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the macular laser group (Peto OR 9.49, 95% CI 2.86 to 31.51; 100 eyes).One study provided very low-certainty evidence comparing anti-VEGF/steroid versus steroid monotherapy at one year. There was no evidence of a meaningful difference in BCVA between treatments at one year (MD 0 VA letters, 95% CI -6.1 to 6.1, low-certainty evidence). Likewise, there was no meaningful difference in the mean CMT at one year (MD - 9 μm, 95% CI -39.87μm to 21.87μm between the anti-VEGF/steroid group and the steroid group. There was very low-certainty evidence on raised IOP at one year comparing the anti-VEGF/steroid versus steroid groups (Peto OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.55).No included study reported impact of treatment on patients' quality of life or economic data. None of the studies reported any cases of endophthalmitis. ### Authors Conclusions Combination of intravitreal anti-VEGF plus intravitreal steroids does not appear to offer additional visual benefit compared with monotherapy for DMO; at present the evidence for this is of low-certainty. There was an increased rate of cataract development and raised intraocular pressure in eyes treated with anti-VEGF plus steroid versus anti-VEGF alone. Patients were exposed to potential side effects of both these agents without reported additional benefit. The majority of the evidence comes from studies of bevacizumab and triamcinolone used as primary therapy for DMO . There is limited evidence from studies using licensed intravitreal anti-VEGF agents plus licensed intravitreal steroid implants with at least one year follow-up. It is not known whether treatment response is different in eyes that are phakic and pseudophakic at baseline.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29669176/", "doc_id": "e3eaa19866764043fe913227f0c1329f"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were eligible. Sequential and concurrent schedules were studied.  RESULTS: Forty-three patients were studied in 9 different dose levels (6 sequential and 3 concurrent). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on the sequential schedule was decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and vorinostat 200 mg three times a day on days 6-12. The MTD on the concurrent schedule was decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 with vorinostat 200 mg twice a day on days 3-9. However, the sequential schedule of decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and vorinostat 200 mg twice a day on days 6-12 was more deliverable than both MTDs with fewer delays on repeated dosing and it represents the recommended phase II (RP2D) dose of this combination.

The promising clinical activity of docetaxel has also promoted considerable interest in combining this drug with other antitumor agents. In this study, we assessed the cytotoxic interaction between docetaxel and doxorubicin administered at various schedules to human breast and ovarian cancer cells. Through a series of in vitro assays including DNA fragmentation analyses, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, and flow cytometric analyses, we found that the antagonistic interaction occurred when tumor cells were exposed to the two drugs simultaneously or exposed to doxorubicin before docetaxel. However, no antagonism was observed when docetaxel was added before doxorubicin. Further analyses demonstrated that doxorubicin could interfere with the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel on both mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death. In addition , biochemical examinations revealed that docetaxel could induce phosphorylation of both bcl-2 and c-raf-1 , but these changes were inhibited when tumor cells were pretreated or simultaneously treated with doxorubicin .

To determine if fluorouracil (5-FU) plus high-dose leucovorin (LV) enhances local response in patients receiving preoperative radiation therapy (RT) for adenocarcinoma of the rectum, we compared the degree of downstaging in patients receiving preoperative RT with or without chemotherapy. ### Patients And Methods For this comparison, three groups of patients who were treated with identical doses and techniques of preoperative pelvic RT (total dose of 5,040 cGy) were examined. Group 1 included 20 patients with unresectable disease who received combined RT and LV/5-FU. Group 2 included 11 patients with unresectable disease who received preoperative RT. Group 3 included 21 patients with invasive, resectable, primary disease who received preoperative RT. ### results Patients with unresectable disease who received LV/5-FU had a higher rate of pathologic complete response (20% v 0%) and a lower incidence of positive nodes (30% v 64%) compared with those who did not receive chemotherapy. Even when the most favorable group of patients was included (group 3), patients who received LV/5-FU still had a higher complete response rate (20% v 6%) and a lower incidence of positive nodes (30% v 53%) compared with those who received RT without LV/5-FU. Of those patients with initially unresectable disease, the resectability rate was higher in those who received LV/5-FU compared with those who did not receive LV/5-FU (90% v 64%). Patients who received LV/5-FU experienced slightly more grade 1 to 2 fatigue, stomatitis, nausea, and grade 3 diarrhea, tenesmus, and dysuria. ### conclusions Despite the fact that patients who received chemotherapy (group 1) had more advanced disease compared with those with resectable disease (group 3), the addition of LV/5-FU increased the resectability and downstaging rates. The ultimate impact of a complete response as well as a decrease in the incidence of pelvic nodes on local control and survival remains to be determined. However, given the enhancement of down-staging in patients with unresectable rectal cancer, we are encouraged by the combined modality approach.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1727928/", "doc_id": "168b963c3be6ac1ded38c2d41bc9b197"}

To analyse the cost-effectiveness of traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) compared to biological therapies from the perspective of Chinese society. ### Methodology Principal Findings A mathematical model was developed by incorporating the clinical trial data and Chinese unit costs and treatment sequences from a lifetime perspective. Hypothetical cohorts with moderate to severe RA were simulated. The primary outcome measure-quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)-was derived from disease severity (HAQ scores). Primary analysis included drug costs, monitoring costs, and other costs. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Treatment sequences that included TNF antagonists and rituximab produced a greater number of QALYs than tDMARDs alone or TNF antagonists plus DMARDs. In comparison with tDMARDs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab without rituximab were $77,357.7, $26,562.4 and $57,838.4 per QALY and $66,422.9, $28,780.6 and $50,937.6 per QALY, for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab with rituximab. No biotherapy was cost-effective under the willingness to pay threshold when the threshold was 3 times the per capita GDP of China. When 3 times the per capita GDP of Shanghai used as the threshold, infliximab and rituximab could yield nearly 90% cost-effective simulations in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. ### Conclusions Significance tDMARD was the most cost-effective option in the Chinese healthcare setting.

In vitro studies reported here showed verapamil sensitization of Adriamycin resistance in 18.8% of fresh human breast cancer specimens tested. Patients (27) were first treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin and dexamethasone (CVAD) alone. Verapamil and quinine were added in patients with tumors failing to respond or progressing on CVAD alone . Following treatment with CVAD alone there were no complete remissions and 3 patients (11%) developed partial remissions lasting 5.5, 8, 10.5 months. With the addition of verapamil and quinine to the CVAD regimen, one patient (4%) developed a complete remission of 11.8 months duration and 4 additional patients (15%) developed partial remissions lasting 2.8, 17.3, 19 and > 40 months.

We compared the responses of the stress hormones, cortisol, ACTH, vasopressin (AVP), corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and catecholamines to elective conventional and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ### design A right upper quadrant transverse incision was used for conventional cholecystectomy, and four 1-2-cm incisions for the laparoscopic procedure (for insertion of surgical instruments, diathermy, fibreoptic telescope and light source, and carbon dioxide insufflation). Blood was sampled immediately prior to premedication ( temazepam ) , after induction of anaesthesia ( fentanyl and thiopentone ) and at 10-minute intervals until the end of the procedure ( N2O maintenance , vecuronium relaxation ) . A blood sample was taken after reversal, and then at 10-minute intervals for 50 minutes. Plasma sodium and blood pressure were measured at similar intervals. Results are expressed as mean +/- standard error. ### patients Twelve patients were studied (six in each group). ### measurements Peptide hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay, cortisol by ELISA and catecholamines by HPLC. ### results The mean premedication hormone values for the conventional and laparoscopic procedures did not increase significantly after induction of anaesthesia. Within 10 minutes of the first incision, however, there was a marked concordant rise in mean plasma ACTH and AVP levels for both procedures (conventional: ACTH, from a premedication value of 10.2 +/- 1.7 to 80.1 +/- 14.3 pmol/l, AVP from 1.2 +/- 0.4 to 117 +/- 24 pmol/l, P < 0.01 for both hormones; laparoscopic: ACTH from 5.8 +/- 2.6 to 55.1 +/- 26.0 pmol/l, AVP from 1.6 +/- 0.11 to 49.2 +/- 27.09 pmol/l). At the end of both types of operation mean levels of ACTH and AVP were still elevated, although the ACTH: AVP ratio had increased. Greater variability in ACTH and AVP responses was seen in the laparoscopic than in the conventional procedure, three patients showing a relatively small response to surgery. Total secretion of ACTH during both types of surgery was not significantly less both during (P < 0.05), and after (P < 0.01) laparoscopic surgery. For both procedures, the timing of AVP and ACTH peaks was significantly related (P < 0.002). A small but significant rise in CRH was observed 30 minutes after the start of surgery for both procedures P < 0.05). The timing of CRH and ACTH peaks was unrelated. The maximum mean plasma cortisol level for the conventional procedure (1268 +/- 147 nmol/l) was reached 20 minutes after reversal of anaesthesia and remained at this level until the end of sampling. The cortisol response was comparable during the laparoscopic procedure but was beginning to fall at 60 minutes post-operatively. Plasma adrenaline responses to the two types of surgery were not significantly different, but the plasma total noradrenaline response to laparoscopic surgery as indicated by the response area during the first 20 minutes was significantly increased (P < 0.02). Plasma sodium, renin activity and initial systolic blood pressure fall were not significantly different during the two procedures. ### conclusions For both procedures, the peak of ACTH secretion after incision is likely to be AVP dependent, and the timing of peak levels of these two hormones was significantly related. Subsequent ACTH secretion may be the result of an interaction between AVP and CRH. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in a smaller AVP rise than does the conventional procedure, and plasma AVP falls more rapidly post-operatively. During the period of observation, ACTH, CRH, cortisol and adrenaline responses were not significantly lessened by the laparoscopic approach, but there was a significant increase in the noradrenaline response.

Mannose-derived conjugates were prepared in two steps, in good yields, by condensing an acid derivative of a protected mannose with the PIs, followed by deprotection of the sugar protecting group. With respect to hydrolysis, these PI prodrugs are chemically stable with half-life times in the 50-60 h range that are compatible with an in vivo utilization aimed at improving the absorption/penetration or accumulation of the prodrug in specific cells/tissues and liberation of the active free drug inside HIV-infected cells. These stabilities correlate closely with the low in vitro anti-HIV activity measured for those prodrugs wherein the coupling of mannose to the PIs was performed through the peptidomimetic PI's hydroxyl. Importantly, mannose conjugation to the PIs was further found to improve the absorptive transepithelial transport of saquinavir and indinavir but not of nelfinavir across Caco-2 cell monolayers, by contrast to glucose conjugation which had the opposite effect.

In metastastic patients , the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin has become the new standard regimen due to a lower toxicity in comparison to the combination of methotrexate , vinblastine , doxorubicin , and cisplatin ( MVAC ) .

Sometime non-adherence and less bioavailability from current therapy develops multidrug resistance, as a result, high dose requirement and subsequent intolerable toxicity are seen. Therefore, nanotechnology gained special attention as it has potential to improve patient compliance, bioavailability and reduction in dosing frequency. ### objective The aim of this study is to fabricate alginate-chitosan nanoparticles (AL-CS NPs) under appropriate conditions using ionic gelation method. The use of natural polymers in nanoparticle fabrication has a vast application due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility and nontoxic nature. Ionic gelation method involves the interaction between macromolecules with opposite charged ionizable groups forming polyelectrolyte complex. Hence, it is rational to formulate natural polymerbased sustained release nano-particulate matrix to improve patient adherence, reducing dose frequency and drug toxicity. ### method The formulations were based on 32 factorial designs. Nanoparticles of combined drug (isoniazid- INH and pyrazinamide-PYZ) were fabricated using natural polymer. Formulation process involved the use of pregelated sodium alginate followed by ionic gelation with chitosan. Pregelation of sodium alginate included calcium chloride. The effects of sodium alginate concentration and chitosan concentration on particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release were studied. ### results Optimized Batch-3s showed particle size 539.7 ± 2.33 nm, zeta potential -26.4 ± 0.55 mV, and entrapment efficiency is 70.21 ± 0.24% and 73.45 ± 0.21% of INH and PYZ, respectively.

One possible mechanism by which this might occur would be for topiramate to increase plasma methamphetamine level.

Pharmacokinetics and antitumour activity studies were performed on normal Kunming mice and female BALB/c nude mice with MDR HL-60 xenografts, respectively. ### results topotecan alone was effective in inhibiting the growth of non-resistant leukaemia cells, K562 and HL-60 cells but not the growth of MDR HL-60 cells. The resistance of topotecan in MDR HL-60 cells was potently reversed by the addition of amlodipine . Moreover, amlodipine enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect of topotecan synergistically. Apoptosis was through activating caspases in a cascade: first, the initiator caspase 8 and then effectors caspase 3/7 (total activity of caspases 3 and 7) were activated. Being encapsulated into the stealthy liposomes with an acidic internal medium, topotecan existed dominantly in an active lactone species, which was reversibly changed from an inactive carboxylate form via a pH-dependent reaction. After administration of stealthy liposomes to mice, the blood exposure of the lactone form was evidently increased and extended. The antitumour effects in the MDR HL-60 xenografted tumour were stealthy liposomal topotecan (SLT) plus amlodipine > SLT > un-encapsulated topotecan > blank control. ### conclusions The enhanced antitumour activity in the MDR HL-60 cells by the SLT plus amlodipine could be owing to multiple reasons: (a) synergistic apoptosis inducing effect, (b) reversing MDR by amlodipine and (c) increasing the availability of active lactone of topotecan by the stealthy liposomes. The apoptosis induced by amlodipine is through caspase 8 and then the 3/7 signalling pathway.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16684125/", "doc_id": "6d1750301095d2936cc280ebf081c991"}

Sedation limits the clinical utility of classical H1 antihistamines, while newer antihistamines such as loratadine and terfenadine are non-sedating. However, clinical use of the terfenadine has been associated with rare but severe cardiac arrhythmias, in particular torsades de pointes. ### objective To establish a quantitative experimental model for assessing the sedating and cardiotoxicity potential of non-sedating and sedating antihistamines. ### methods Drugs were administered intravenously and the integrated amplitude of the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) signal was recorded. The threshold dose that depressed EEG activity was compared with the dose required to inhibit by 50% the peripheral bronchospasm elicited by 10 micrograms/kg i.v., of histamine.

We were unable to evaluate the EEG effects of terfenadine, because it produced cardiovascular collapse at 10 mg/kg, i.v. loratadine and promethazine did not produce adverse cardiovascular effects, nor did they alter normal ECG activity. diphenhydramine produced bradycardia followed by a transient hypertensive phase without affecting the QTc interval. In contrast, terfenadine elicited hypotension, bradycardia and significant arrhythmogenic activity, causing a prolongation of the QTc interval and a torsades de pointes--like ventricular arrhythmia. Pharmacokinetic studies after i.v. administration of loratadine (30 and 100 mg/kg) demonstrated plasma levels of loratadine and its major metabolite descarboethoxyloratadine to be several orders of magnitude greater than levels found in humans at the clinical dose of 10 mg. ### conclusion The CNS depressant effects of H1 antihistamines are promethazine approximately diphenhydramine >> loratadine = placebo.

All dose levels were tolerable for regimen 1 (n = 18: 15 NSCLC and 3 esophageal cancers) and regimen 2 (n = 12: all NSCLC). In regimen 1, one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 4 esophagitis/anorexia) occurred (500 mg/m(2)). Grade 3 neutropenia (3 of 18 patients) was the main hematologic toxicity.

Exercise prescriptions will be tailored to each participant's fitness and morbidities. The primary endpoint is OS. Secondary endpoints include time to disease progression, occurrence of a skeletal-related event or progression of pain, and degree of pain, opiate use, physical and emotional quality of life, and changes in metabolic biomarkers. An assessment of whether immune function, inflammation, dysregulation of insulin and energy metabolism, and androgen biomarkers are associated with OS will be performed, and whether they mediate the primary association between exercise and OS will also be investigated. This study will also establish a biobank for future biomarker discovery or validation. ### Ethics And Dissemination Validation of exercise as medicine and its mechanisms of action will create evidence to change clinical practice.

First line chemotherapeutics for brain tumors (malignant gliomas) are alkylating agents such as temozolomide and nimustine. Despite growing knowledge of how these agents work, patients suffering from this malignancy still face a dismal prognosis. Alkylating agents target DNA, forming the killing lesion O(6)-alkylguanine, which is converted into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that trigger apoptosis. Here we assessed whether inhibiting repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a reasonable strategy for sensitizing glioma cells to alkylating agents. For down-regulation of HR in glioma cells, we used an interference RNA (iRNA) approach targeting Rad51 and BRCA2, and for NHEJ we employed the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026. We also assessed whether inhibition of poly(ADP)ribosyltransferase (PARP) by olaparib would enhance the killing effect. The data show that knockdown of Rad51 or BRCA2 greatly sensitizes cells to DSBs and the induction of cell death following temozolomide and nimustine ( ACNU ) . It did not sensitize to ionizing radiation (IR). The expression of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) abolished all these effects, indicating that O(6)-alkylguanine induced by these drugs is the primary lesion responsible for the formation of DSBs and increased sensitivity of glioma cells following knockdown of Rad51 and BRCA2. Inhibition of DNA-PK only slightly sensitized to temozolomide whereas a significant effect was observed with IR. A triple strategy including siRNA and the PARP inhibitor olaparib further improved the killing effect of temozolomide. The data provides evidence that down-regulation of Rad51 or BRCA2 is a reasonable strategy for sensitizing glioma cells to killing by O(6)-alkylating anti-cancer drugs. The data also provide proof of principle that a triple strategy involving down-regulation of HR, PARP inhibition and MGMT depletion may greatly enhance the therapeutic effect of temozolomide.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22073281/", "doc_id": "76b596dbb2298d1ba4668068b940f4c9"}

During recent years, more intensified systemic and local treatment regimens have increased the 5-year survival figures in localized Ewing's sarcoma to more than 60%. There is, however, concern about the risk of second malignancies (SM) in long-term survivors. We have analyzed the second malignancies in patients treated in the German Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. ### Materials And Methods From January 1981 through June 1991, 674 patients were registered in the two sequential multicentric Ewing's sarcoma trials CESS 81 (recruitment period 1981-1985) and CESS 86 (1986-1991). The systemic treatment in both studies consisted of a four-drug-regimen ( VACA = vincristine , actinomycin D , cyclophosphamide , and adriamycin ; or VAIA = vincristine , actinomycin D , ifosfamide , and adriamycin ) and a total number of four courses , each lasting nine weeks , was recommended by the protocol . Local therapy in curative patients was either complete surgery (n = 162), surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with 36-46Gy (n = 274), or definitive radiotherapy with 46-60Gy (n = 212). The median follow-up at the time of this analysis was 5.1 years, the maximum follow-up 16.5 years. ### results The overall survival of all patients including metastatic patients was 55% after 5 years, 48% after 10 years, and 37% after 15 years. Eight out of 674 patients (1.2%) developed a SM. Five of these were acute myelogenic leukemias (n = 4) or MDS (n = 1), and three were sarcomas. The interval between diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma and the diagnosis of the SM was 17-78 months for the four AMLs, 96 months for the MDS and 82-136 months for the three sarcomas. The cumulative risk of an SM was 0.7% after 5 years, 2.9% after 10 years, and 4.7% after 15 years. Out of five patients with AML/MDS, three died of rapid AML-progression, and two are living with disease. Local therapy (surgery vs. surgery plus postoperative irradiation vs. definitive radiotherapy) had no impact on the frequency of AML/MDS, but local therapy did influence the risk of secondary sarcomas. All three patients with secondary sarcomas had received radiotherapy; however, all three sarcomas were salvaged by subsequent treatment and are in clinical remission with a follow-up of 1 month, 4.3 years, and 7.5 years after the diagnosis of the secondary sarcoma. Thus far, SM contributed to less than 1 % (3/328) of all deaths in the CESS-studies. ### conclusions The risk of leukemia after treatment for Ewing's sarcoma is probably in the range of 2%. The risk of solid tumors also seems to be low within the first 10 years after treatment and remains in the range of 5 % after 15 years. In the CESS-studies, less than 1% of all deaths within the first 10 years after diagnosis were caused by SM. Effective salvage therapy for secondary sarcomas is feasible.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9788419/", "doc_id": "be817a111debcf11e63cf8c34861fed7"}

The aim of the present article is to provide an updated review of clinically relevant metabolic drug interactions between selected anticancer drugs and antidepressants, focusing on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and Hypericum extract. SSRIs can cause pharmacokinetic interactions through their in vitro ability to inhibit one or more cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs). SSRIs differ in their potential for metabolic drug interactions with anticancer drugs. Fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 and administration of these SSRIs reduces the clinical benefit of an anticancer drug , such as tamoxifen , by decreasing the formation of active metabolites of this drug . Women with breast cancer who receive paroxetine in combination with tamoxifen are at increased risk for death. Other SSRIs, including citalopram, escitalopram, are weak or negligible inhibitors of CYP2D6 and are less likely to interact with anticancer drugs, while sertraline causes significant inhibition of this isoform only at high doses. Hypericum extract, by inducing both the CYP3A4 and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), can reduce the plasma concentrations of different antineoplastic agents such as imatinib, irinotecan and docetaxel, thus reducing the clinical efficacy of these drugs.

Despite advances in molecular medicine over recent decades, there has been little advancement in the treatment of osteosarcoma.

The DNA from each sample was sequenced to high, uniform coverage. Immunohistochemical probes and morphoproteomics analysis were performed, in addition to fluorescence in situ hybridization. All analyses were performed in CLIA-certified laboratories. Molecularly targeted therapy based on the resulting profiles was offered to the patients. Biomedical analytics were performed using QIAGEN's Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis. ### results In Patient #1, comprehensive next-generation exome sequencing showed MET amplification, PIK3CA mutation, CCNE1 amplification, and PTPRD mutation. Immunohistochemistry-based morphoproteomic analysis revealed c-Met expression [(p)-c-Met (Tyr1234/1235)] and activation of mTOR/AKT pathway [IGF-1R (Tyr1165/1166), p-mTOR [Ser2448], p-Akt (Ser473)] and expression of SPARC and COX2.

Consenting patients with newly diagnosed, resectable, high-grade osteosarcoma aged 40 years or younger were eligible for randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either postoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (MAP) or MAP plus ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE) using concealed permuted blocks with three stratification factors: trial group; location of tumour (proximal femur or proximal humerus vs other limb vs axial skeleton); and presence of metastases (no vs yes or possible). The MAP regimen consisted of cisplatin 120 mg/m ### findings Between April 14, 2005, and June 30, 2011, 2260 patients were registered from 325 sites in 17 countries. 618 patients with poor response were randomly assigned; 310 to receive MAP and 308 to receive MAPIE. Median follow-up was 62·1 months (IQR 46·6-76·6); 62·3 months (IQR 46·9-77·1) for the MAP group and 61·1 months (IQR 46·5-75·3) for the MAPIE group. 307 event-free survival events were reported (153 in the MAP group vs 154 in the MAPIE group). 193 deaths were reported (101 in the MAP group vs 92 in the MAPIE group). Event-free survival did not differ between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0·98 [95% CI 0·78-1·23]); hazards were non-proportional (p=0·0003). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (268 [89%] patients in MAP vs 268 [90%] in MAPIE), thrombocytopenia (231 [78% in MAP vs 248 [83%] in MAPIE), and febrile neutropenia without documented infection (149 [50%] in MAP vs 217 [73%] in MAPIE). MAPIE was associated with more frequent grade 4 non-haematological toxicity than MAP (35 [12%] of 301 in the MAP group vs 71 [24%] of 298 in the MAPIE group). Two patients died during postoperative therapy, one from infection (although their absolute neutrophil count was normal), which was definitely related to their MAP treatment (specifically doxorubicin and cisplatin), and one from left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which was probably related to MAPIE treatment (specifically doxorubicin). One suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction was reported in the MAP group: bone marrow infarction due to methotrexate. ### interpretation EURAMOS-1 results do not support the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to postoperative chemotherapy in patients with poorly responding osteosarcoma because its administration was associated with increased toxicity without improving event-free survival .

The minimal or moderate survival benefit-depending on prognostic features-and the severe toxicity associated with the MVAC regimen have made the search for new drugs and drug combinations of utmost importance to increase efficacy and/or decrease toxicity. In this respect, the taxanes and gemcitabine are promising new drugs. Paclitaxel and docetaxel as single agents have yielded overall response rates of 7 % to 56 % , depending on whether the patients have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease . The combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin has been explored in three studies with a total of 104 evaluable patients, a pooled overall response (OR) rate of 61%, and a complete response (CR) rate of 20%. There are two studies of docetaxel and cisplatin with a total of 91 evaluable patients, an OR rate of 54%, and a CR rate of 16%. The OR rate for paclitaxel and carboplatin in six studies was 43%, with a CR rate of 13%; however, the reported median survival was only 8.5 to 9.5 months. The OR rate for single-agent gemcitabine based on five studies was 26%, with a CR rate of 9%, which was apparently independent of whether the patients had received prior chemotherapy. The OR rate for gemcitabine and cisplatin in four phase II studies ranged from 41% to 57%, with a CR rate of 15% to 22% and a median survival of 12.5 to 14.3 months.

This study of 405 randomized patients showed that the two regimens were associated with similar response rates, time to progression, and overall survival, whereas GC was associated with less toxicity than MVAC. On the basis of this superior risk-benefit ratio, the GC regimen should be favored as a new standard treatment in patients with locally advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer. Other promising combinations include gemcitabine and paclitaxel, with or without cisplatin, and the combination of ifosfamide, paclitaxel, and cisplatin.

PATIENTS AND METHODS RNA was extracted from 1,372 tumor blocks from postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer in the monotherapy arms of ATAC. Twenty-one genes were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and the RS was calculated. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the value of adding RS to a model with clinical variables (age, tumor size, grade, and treatment) in node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N+) women. RESULTS Reportable scores were available from 1,231 evaluable patients (N0, n = 872; N+, n = 306; and node status unknown, n = 53); 72, 74, and six DRs occurred in N0, N+, and node status unknown patients, respectively. For both N0 and N+ patients, RS was significantly associated with time to DR in multivariate analyses (P < .001 for N0 and P = .002 for N+). RS also showed significant prognostic value beyond that provided by Adjuvant! Online (P < .001).

Given the availability of a number of alternative biologic treatment options and other novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinicians are faced with an increasingly challenging choice regarding optimal treatment. Biologics are usually combined with traditional DMARDs, primarily methotrexate (MTX), but some biologics and tofacitinib (together referred to in this article as novel DMARDs) have been shown to be efficacious as monotherapy as well. In real-world practice, approximately one-third of RA patients receiving biologics are on monotherapy, primarily because of intolerance of, or noncompliance with, MTX. Limited data, however, are available analyzing the effectiveness of monotherapy compared with combination therapy across novel DMARDs. ### objective To compare American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses to approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) at 24 weeks in RA patients who have shown inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (DMARD-IR). ### methods Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified randomized controlled trials that assessed approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with MTX in DMARD-IR RA patients. Twenty-eight RCTs were identified that evaluated abatacept, anakinra, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib. ACR responses at 24 weeks were extracted and combined by means of Bayesian network meta-analyses. ### results With the exception of anakinra plus MTX, which was less efficacious, most novel DMARDs, when used in combination with MTX, demonstrated comparable ACR responses. When novel DMARDs were used as monotherapies , greater ACR20/50/70 responses were observed with tocilizumab than with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents ( aTNF ) or tofacitinib . Furthermore, ACR20/50/70 responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab monotherapy (odds ratio [OR] for the indirect comparison = 1.08, 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.40-2.84; OR = 1.24, CrI = 0.44-3.61; OR = 0.95, CrI = 0.33-2.72, respectively), whereas greater responses were observed with aTNF plus MTX than with aTNF monotherapy (OR = 2.41, CrI = 0.51-11.61; OR = 2.85, CrI = 0.51-17.67; OR = 1.28, CrI = 0.21-8.42, respectively). Relative efficacy estimates for the indirect comparison of tofacitinib plus MTX with tofacitinib monotherapy were very uncertain. ### conclusions Results suggest that in combination with MTX most of the available novel DMARDs have similar levels of efficacy in DMARD-IR patients. As monotherapy, however, tocilizumab displayed higher ACR responses than aTNF or tofacitinib.

Late antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) triggered by donor-specific antibodies (DSA) is a cardinal cause of kidney allograft dysfunction and loss. Diagnostic criteria for this rejection type are well established, but effective treatment remains a major challenge. Recent randomized controlled trials ( RCT ) have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of widely used therapies , such as rituximab plus intravenous immunoglobulin or proteasome inhibition ( bortezomib ) , reinforcing a great need for new therapeutic concepts . One promising target in this context may be interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine known to play an important role in inflammation and adaptive immunity. ### methods This investigator-driven RCT was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of clazakizumab, a genetically engineered humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6. The study will include 20 DSA-positive kidney allograft recipients diagnosed with ABMR ≥ 365 days after transplantation. Participants will be recruited at two study sites in Austria and Germany (Medical University of Vienna; Charité University Medicine Berlin). First, patients will enter a three-month double-blind RCT (1,1 randomization, stratification according to ABMR phenotype and study site) and will receive either clazakizumab (subcutaneous administration of 25 mg in monthly intervals) or placebo. In a second open-label part of the trial (months 4-12), all patients will receive clazakizumab at 25 mg every month. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints are the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clazakizumab, its effect on drug metabolism in the liver, DSA characteristics, morphological ABMR lesions and molecular gene expression patterns in three- and 12-month protocol biopsies, serum/urinary biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial activation/injury, Torque Teno viral load as a measure of overall immunosuppression, kidney function, urinary protein excretion, as well as transplant and patient survival. ### discussion Currently, there is no treatment proven to be effective in halting the progression of late ABMR. Based on the hypothesis that antagonizing the effects of IL-6 improves the outcome of DSA-positive late ABMR by counteracting DSA-triggered inflammation and B cell/plasma cell-driven alloimmunity, we suggest that our trial has the potential to provide proof of concept of a novel treatment of this type of rejection. ### Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03444103 .

Historically, ephedrine has been the vasopressor of choice for treatment of most cases of hypotension in obstetric patients.

The current study evaluated whether ephedrine or phenylephrine better restores uterine blood flow and fetal oxygenation during ritodrine infusion and epidural anesthesia-induced hypotension in gravid ewes. ### methods Fourteen chronically instrumented gravid ewes between 0.8 and 0.9 timed gestational age were used. On separate days, each animal underwent the experimental protocol with one of three agents: ephedrine, phenylephrine, and normal saline-control. The experimental protocol was as follows : ( 1 ) at time zero , intravenous infusion of ritodrine was begun ; ( 2 ) at 120 min , 2 % lidocaine was given epidurally to achieve a sensory level of at least T6 ; and ( 3 ) at 135 min , an intravenous bolus of either ephedrine , phenylephrine , or normal saline-control was given , followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of the same agent for 30 min . In the ephedrine and phenylephrine experiments, the rate of infusion was adjusted to maintain maternal mean arterial pressure close to baseline. ### results ritodrine infusion alone significantly increased maternal heart rate and cardiac output in all three groups. Epidural anesthesia during ritodrine infusion significantly decreased maternal mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, uterine blood flow, and fetal arterial oxygen tension for each of the three groups.

During a 52-month period, 131 patients were registered of whom 122 (93%) were study eligible. Sixty-one eligible patients were randomized to the FTBI/VP-16 arm and 61 to the BU/CY regimen. Of these 122 patients, 114 (93%) proceeded to BMT according to protocol. Posttransplant immunosuppression to prevent graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) consisted of cyclosporine and prednisone ( CSA/PSE ) . Neither overall survival nor disease-free survival (DFS) differed significantly between the two treatment groups (P = .89 and .69, respectively). Estimated DFS for \"good-risk\" patients who had been prepared with the FTBI/VP-16 regimen was 55% +/- 11%, as compared with patients treated with BU/CY whose DFS figure was 34% +/- 10% (P = .30). For \"poor-risk\" candidates, the DFS rates at 24 months were 17% +/- 6% (for FTBI/VP-16) and 24% +/- 8% (for BU/CY), respectively (P = .81). These figures do not differ significantly, especially in view of the fact that the \"good-risk\" patients prepared with the FTBI/VP-16 regimen were younger than those treated with BU/CY. Both regimens were well tolerated with no regimen-related deaths encountered during the 6-week period after BMT. This study also confirmed the efficacy of the CSA/PSE combination in the prevention of GVHD with 23 of 113 (20%) of BMT recipients developing moderate to severe acute GVHD. The leading cause for treatment failure was leukemic relapse (45 of the 114 BMT recipients suffered a recurrence of their leukemia), whereas 38 patients died without evidence of relapse. Thirty-one patients are alive and in continued CR after marrow transplantation; four are alive in relapse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8471778/", "doc_id": "dc747d23089de0920b9129198f64388e"}

Reactivity of factor IXa with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is enhanced by low molecular weight heparin ( enoxaparin ) .

We examined the reactivity of factor IXa with several isolated Kunitz-type inhibitor domains: basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2, and the first two inhibitor domains of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. We find that enhancement of factor IXa reactivity by enoxaparin is greatest for basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (>10-fold), followed by the second tissue factor pathway inhibitor domain (1.7-fold) and the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2 (1.4-fold). Modeling studies of factor IXa with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor suggest that binding of this inhibitor is sterically hindered by the 99-loop of factor IXa, specifically residue Lys(98). Slow-binding kinetic studies support the formation of a weak initial enzyme-inhibitor complex between factor IXa and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor that is facilitated by enoxaparin binding. Mutation of Lys(98) to Ala in factor IXa results in enhanced reactivity with all inhibitors examined, whereas almost completely abrogating the enhancing effects of enoxaparin.

We aimed to clarify the effects of aspirin/cilostazol therapy on the platelet and endothelial functions of patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, in comparison to patients who were treated with aspirin alone. Methods The present randomized prospective pilot study enrolled 24 patients within a week after the onset of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (100 mg/day) (A group; 11 patients) or cilostazol (200 mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day) (CA group; 13 patients). We measured platelet aggregation, platelet activation, and the thrombomodulin (TM), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and von Willebrand (vWF) antigen levels and vWF activity over a 4-week period after enrollment. Results There was no significant difference in the platelet functions of the A and CA groups. However, the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was decreased at 2 and 4 weeks (p<0.05) after treatment in comparison to the pre-treatment values in the CA group, but not in the A group. Platelet activation, and the hs-CRP, TM, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and vWF values did not significantly decrease after treatment in either group. Conclusion Although there were no significant differences in platelet aggregation, platelet activation or the endothelial biomarker levels of the A and CA groups, dual therapy with aspirin and cilostazol inhibited platelet aggregation in comparison to the pre-treatment values, similarly to patients who received aspirin alone.

The pertinent downstream mediators of antitumor efficacy were tested in transient transfection and RNA interference experiments. ### results Cyclin E1 mRNA and protein expressions were suppressed after sorafenib treatment in sorafenib-sensitive but not in sorafenib-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Changes in cyclin E2 or D1 were not correlated with sorafenib sensitivity. The knockdown of cyclin E1 expression reversed the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to sorafenib in terms of cell growth and apoptosis induction, whereas the overexpression of cyclin E1 increased the resistance to sorafenib. The growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects of sorafenib were enhanced by flavopiridol, and Mcl-1 suppression was determined to play a critical role in mediating this enhancing effect. ### conclusions The cyclin E1 suppression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells may serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for predicting sorafenib efficacy.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Herein, we first reported the codelivery of sorafenib and curcumin by directed self-assembled nanoparticles (SCN) to enhance the therapeutic effect on HCC. SCN was formed by employing the hydrophobic interactions among the lipophilic structure in sorafenib, curcumin, and similar hydrophobic segments of polyethylene glycol derivative of vitamin E succinate (PEG-VES), which comprised uniform spherical particles with particle size of 84.97 ± 6.03 nm. SCN presented superior effects over sorafenib, curcumin, and their physical mixture (Sora + Cur) on enhancing in vitro cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis in BEL-7402 cells and Hep G2 cells, and antiangiogenesis activities in tube formation and microvessel formation from aortic rings. Moreover, the tissue concentration of sorafenib and curcumin in gastrointestinal tract and major organs were significantly improved after their coassembly into SCN. In particular, in BEL-7402 cells induced tumor xenograft, SCN treatment displayed the obviously enhanced inhibitory effect on tumor progression over free drug monotherapy or their physical mixture, with significantly increased antiproliferation and antiangiogenesis capability.

To assess synergy of paclitaxel and rapamycin, the combination index (CI) was calculated by the method of Chou and Talalay. Simultaneous exposure of cells to various doses of paclitaxel in combination with rapamycin (1 nM) resulted in a significant synergistic anti-proliferative effect (CI <1, range 0.131-0.920). rapamycin alone did not induce apoptosis, but combined treatment with paclitaxel increased apoptosis over that of paclitaxel alone. Treatment with rapamycin and paclitaxel resulted in decreased phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 , two critical downstream targets of the mTOR pathway . rapamycin decreased hTERT mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR while paclitaxel alone had no effect on telomerase activity. paclitaxel increased polymerization and acetylation of tubulin, and rapamycin appeared to enhance this effect.

In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), leukemic stem cells (LSC) represent a critical target of therapy. However, little is known about markers and targets expressed by LSCs. The aim of this project was to identify novel relevant markers of CML LSCs. ### Experimental Design CML LSCs were examined by flow cytometry, qPCR, and various bioassays. In addition, we examined the multipotent CD25(+)CML cell line KU812. ### results In contrast to normal hematopoietic stem cells, CD34(+)/CD38(-)CML LSCs expressed the IL-2 receptor alpha chain, IL-2RA (CD25). STAT5 was found to induce expression of CD25 in Lin(-)/Sca-1(+)/Kit(+)stem cells in C57Bl/6 mice. Correspondingly, shRNA-induced STAT5 depletion resulted in decreased CD25 expression in KU812 cells. Moreover , the BCR/ABL1 inhibitors nilotinib and ponatinib were found to decrease STAT5 activity and CD25 expression in KU812 cells and primary CML LSCs . A CD25-targeting shRNA was found to augment proliferation of KU812 cellsin vitroand their engraftmentin vivoin NOD/SCID-IL-2Rγ(-/-)mice. In drug-screening experiments, the PI3K/mTOR blocker BEZ235 promoted the expression of STAT5 and CD25 in CML cells. Finally, we found that BEZ235 produces synergistic antineoplastic effects on CML cells when applied in combination with nilotinib or ponatinib. ### conclusions CD25 is a novel STAT5-dependent marker of CML LSCs and may be useful for LSC detection and LSC isolation in clinical practice and basic science. Moreover, CD25 serves as a growth regulator of CML LSCs, which may have biologic and clinical implications and may pave the way for the development of new more effective LSC-eradicating treatment strategies in CML.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26607600/", "doc_id": "0a4bbd89b0116fe38b5aa37d3710db43"}

Prior treatment with SSAs and any systemic or locoregional therapy was allowed except for mTOR inhibitors. Patients continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months; secondary endpoints included early biochemical response, objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.0, overall survival (OS), AEs, activation of mTOR pathway (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor [IGF1R] and phosphoS6 [pS6] expression). ### results Forty-three patients were included in the intent-to-treat analyses. After 12 months of treatment, 62.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48%-77%) of patients had not progressed or died. The 24-month PFS rate was 43.6% (95% CI 29%-58%). The confirmed ORR was 2.3%, and stable disease was 58.1%. Median OS was not reached after 24 months of median follow-up. Dose reductions and temporary interruptions due to AEs were required in 14 (33%) and 33 (77%) patients, respectively. The most frequent AEs were diarrhea, asthenia, mucositis, rash, and hyperglycemia.

Synergism between anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody ( trastuzumab ) and paclitaxel has been shown in vitro and in vivo . In previous experiences, weekly administration of trastuzumab and paclitaxel has shown significant activity in metastatic breast cancer. In this phase II study, we evaluated the activity and the toxicity of this weekly regimen in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Between November 1999 and July 2001, 25 patients were treated with trastuzumab (4 mg kg(-1) i.v. loading dose followed by 2 mg kg(-1) i.v. week(-1)) and paclitaxel (60-90 mg m(-2) h(-1) i.v. infusion week(-1)). The treatment was planned to continue until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity; in patients with responsive or stable disease, after 6 months of therapy, the decision to stop paclitaxel while continuing weekly trastuzumab was left to the physicians' judgement. At the median follow-up of 19.6 months (range 9.2-38.1), all patients are evaluable for response and toxicity. We obtained four (16%) complete responses (CR), 10 (40%) partial responses (PR), four (16%) stable diseases and seven (28%) disease progressions. The response rate (CR+PR) was 56% (95% CI, 36.5-75.5%). The median duration of response was 10.4 months (range 4.1-24.2+). Median time to progression was 8.6 months (range 2.5-24.2+).

The randomised phase 3 TURANDOT trial compared two approved bevacizumab-containing regimens for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in terms of efficacy, safety, and quality of life. The interim analysis did not confirm non-inferior overall survival (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 1·04; 97·5% repeated CI [RCI] -∞ to 1·69). Here we report final results of our study aiming to show non-inferior overall survival with first-line bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. ### methods In this multinational, open-label, randomised phase 3 TURANDOT trial, patients aged 18 years or older who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2 and measurable or non-measurable HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had received no previous chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were stratified and randomly assigned (1:1) using permuted blocks of size six to either bevacizumab plus paclitaxel (bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks) or bevacizumab plus capecitabine (bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on day 1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 every 3 weeks) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Stratification factors were oestrogen or progesterone receptor status, country, and menopausal status. The primary objective was to show non-inferior overall survival with bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel in the per-protocol population by rejecting the null hypothesis of inferiority (HR ≥1·33) using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00600340. ### findings Between Sept 10, 2008, and Aug 30, 2010, 564 patients were randomised, representing the intent-to-treat population. The per-protocol population comprised 531 patients (266 in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group and 265 in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group). At the final overall survival analysis after 183 deaths (69%) in 266 patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and 201 (76%) in 265 receiving bevacizumab plus capecitabine in the per-protocol population, median overall survival was 30·2 months (95% CI 25·6-32·6 months) versus 26·1 months (22·3-29·0), respectively. The stratified HR was 1·02 (97·5% RCI -∞ to 1·26; repeated p=0·0070), indicating non-inferiority. The unstratified Cox model (HR 1·13 [97·5% RCI -∞ to 1·39]; repeated p=0·061) did not support the primary analysis. Intent-to-treat analyses were consistent with the per-protocol results. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (54 [19%] of 284 patients in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group vs 5 [2%] of 277 patients in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group), hand-foot syndrome (1 [<1%] vs 43 [16%]), peripheral neuropathy (39 [14%] vs 1 [<1%]), leucopenia (20 [7%] vs 1 [<1%]), and hypertension (12 [4%] vs 16 [6%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 65 (23%) of 284 patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and 68 (25%) of 277 receiving bevacizumab plus capecitabine. Deaths in two (1%) of 284 patients in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group were deemed by the investigator to be treatment-related. No treatment-related deaths occurred in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group. ### interpretation bevacizumab plus capecitabine represents a valid first-line treatment option for HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, offering good tolerability without compromising overall survival compared with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel. Although progression-free survival with the bevacizumab plus capecitabine combination is inferior to that noted with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel, we suggest that physicians should consider possible predictive risk factors for overall survival, individual's treatment priorities, and the differing safety profiles. ### funding Roche.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27501767/", "doc_id": "2280600696c1c1d4dfb49c7feb372ecd"}

For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity. ### objective To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone. ### Design Setting And Participants Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012. ### interventions Cephalexin , 500 mg 4 times daily , plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily , for 7 days ( n = 248 participants ) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days ( n = 248 participants ) . ### Main Outcomes And Measures The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%. ### results Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; P = .50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P = .07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly. ### Conclusions And Relevance Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed. ### Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00729937.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535235/", "doc_id": "d531c7b35a8bc9c67dad085ae9b7d352"}

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the magnitude of H.pylori antibiotic resistance in Africa to gain insight of the extent of the problem among H.pylori naïve treatment patients. ### method The search was performed in the academic databases, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science and Africa Wide Information. ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, Scopus, Ethos, Africa Index Medicus (WHO), BioMed Central Proceedings, BASE, British Library, Open grey, Library of Congress and the New York Academy of Grey Literature Report were additionally searched for grey literature. Published articles from Africa on H.pylori antibiotic resistance between 1986 and June 2017 were systematically reviewed to estimate the H. pylori extent of resistance to macrolides, quinolones, amoxicillin, tetracycline and metronidazole. ### results In 26 articles a total of 2085 isolates were tested for metronidazole, 1530 for amoxicillin, 1277 for tetracycline, 1752 for clarithromycin and 823 for quinolones.The overall pooled proportion of H.pylori resistance to quinolones, clarithromycin, tetracycline, metronidazole and amoxicillin were: (17.4%, 95%CI 12.8 - 21.9), (29.2%, 95%CI:26.7-31.8), (48.7%, 95%CI: 44.5-52.9), (75.8%, 95% CI: 74.1-.77.4) and (72.6%, 95% CI: 68.6-76.6), respectively. The commonest mutation detected were A2143G (49/97) for clarithromycin, RdxA (41/56) for metronidazole and D87I (16/40) for quinolones. ### conclusion Prevalence of metronidazole , clarithromycin , and amoxicillin resistance is high in developing world including Africa . This could impair the first line triple therapy of the H.pylori infection. There is a need of conducting surveillance of H.pylori susceptibility pattern in Africa for dual and triple resistance which can be used for the empirical treatment.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29699490/", "doc_id": "4c286a03b81e5883cc213110576889fa"}

Ongoing research is aimed at identifying and understanding the benefit of established and emerging therapies in this disease setting. Triple-negative patients may achieve early responses to anthracyclines and taxanes, but novel strategies are also eagerly sought. The epothilone B analog ixabepilone acts to stabilize microtubules and demonstrates antitumor activity in recent breast cancer studies. Herein, we have analyzed efficacy and safety data of ixabepilone specifically for the treatment of women with triple-negative disease. A retrospective analysis was completed using activity and toxicity data in the triple-negative subsets from 5 phase II studies. In addition, a prospective pooled analysis of triple-negative patients from 2 phase III trials is also reviewed. Of 2,261 patients evaluated in these trials, 556 (24.5%) had triple-negative tumors. In the neoadjuvant setting, ixabepilone produced a pathologic complete response rate in the breast of 26% in triple-negative patients (vs. 15% in the non-triple-negative population). In patients with metastatic breast cancer whose pretreatment status ranged from no prior therapy to progression on several classes of agents, overall response rates (ORR) in the phase II ixabepilone monotherapy trials ranged from 6 to 55%, comparable to rates seen in patients with non-triple-negative tumors. The combination of ixabepilone and capecitabine in the phase II study resulted in an ORR of 23 % in triple-negative patients . A similar ORR (31%) was observed for a preplanned pooled analysis of triple-negative patients in the phase III trials of ixabepilone plus capecitabine.

No increase in toxicity was noted in the triple-negative subgroup compared with other patients. ixabepilone shows notable antitumor activity in patients with triple-negative breast cancer when used in a variety of settings. The addition of ixabepilone to capecitabine results in an approximately twofold increase in median PFS for triple-negative patients versus capecitabine alone and responses to ixabepilone in triple-negative disease are comparable to those seen in patients with non-triple-negative tumors.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20229176/", "doc_id": "f5280bfb01586dd9949743d020881015"}

A healthy fetus was delivered by induced delivery and trastuzumab-based treatment was initiated. Although the multiple liver metastases were controlled successfully by trastuzumab combined with paclitaxel, the primary tumor continued to expand even after subsequent administration of three other treatment regimens including anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 agents and cytotoxic drugs. To inhibit primary tumor growth, a combination therapy with paclitaxel and bevacizumab was subsequently initiated. Following therapy initiation, however, the large tumor occupying the patient's entire left breast became necrotic and ulcerated rapidly. Furthermore, massive hemorrhage from the tumor occurred 5 weeks after bevacizumab-based therapy initiation.

Based on higher response rates, longer time to progression, and marked improvement in median survival (37.5 months compared with 24.4 months), the Gynecologic Oncology Group currently considers paclitaxel plus cisplatin to be the new standard regimen for patients with advanced disease.

The standard of care and novel treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are reviewed. ### summary Recent advances in the treatment of CLL have dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape for both patients and health care professionals. The majority of conventional first-line therapies are noncurative and are only used to treat disease that is symptomatic or progressive and include chlorambucil, monotherapy with purine analogues, and combination chemotherapy. Immunotherapeutic agents such as rituximab and alemtuzumab may be indicated in select patient populations. However, because clinical trials have found that overall survival does not depend on the initial therapy, selection of first-line therapy should be based on patient-specific factors and the patient's goals for therapy with respect to response, survival, and symptom palliation. Progression-free survival time and time to treatment are critical endpoints for CLL treatment. An increasingly important endpoint is minimal residual disease (MRD), as it is considered to be the major cause of relapse in CLL. Finally, comparison of toxicities between different therapies is critical in CLL, as it is in other disease states. Several new agents are currently being evaluated for use in CLL, including alvocidib, oblimersen, and lumiliximab. ### conclusion Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients with CLL. The introduction of rituximab , alemtuzumab , and bendamustine has improved the current outlook for patients with CLL . As overall survival does not appear to depend on the initial therapy, treatment should be selected based on patient-specific factors and goals.

Fibrosing, non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (non-IPF) interstitial lung diseases (fILDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by a different amount of inflammation and fibrosis. Therapy is currently based on corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators. However, response to these therapies is highly variable, sometimes without meaningful improvement, especially in more fibrosing forms. pirfenidone and nintedanib have recently demonstrated to reduce functional decline in patients with IPF. However, their antifibrotic mechanism makes these two drugs an interesting approach for treatment of fibrosing ILDs other than IPF. ### objectives We here report our experience with antifibrotic drugs in fibrosing non-IPF ILDs patients having a progressive phenotype during immunosuppressive therapy. ### methods Patients with a multidisciplinary team diagnosis of fibrosing non-IPF ILDs experiencing a progressive phenotype during treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators between October-2014 and January-2018 at our tertiary referral Center for ILDs were retrospectively analyzed. Antifibrotic therapy was administered after application with the respective health insurance company and after consent by the patient. Pulmonary-function-tests and follow-up visits were performed every 6 ± 1 months. ### results Eleven patients were treated with antifibrotic drugs (8 males, mean age 62 ± 12.8 years, mean FVC% 62.8 ± 22.3, mean DLCO% 35.5 ± 10.7, median follow-up under antifibrotic treatment 11.1 months).

The model compared tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day (BID) either as monotherapy or in combination with MTX with similarly labeled biologic therapies. Response to treatment was modeled as American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 response. ACR20 represented clinical response and determined whether patients continued therapy. ACR response rates at 6-month intervals were sourced from prescribing information and safety event rates from a published meta-analysis. Following an adverse event or a lack of response to treatment, it was assumed that 75% of patients switched to the next line of treatment (first to abatacept and then to rituximab). The perspective was that of a U.S. payer. Costs were reported in 2015 U.S. dollars and included drug wholesale acquisition costs, monitoring, drug administration, and treatment for minor and serious adverse events. The patient population eligible for treatment was based on the total number of members (i.e., RA and non-RA) in a payer organization; members with RA treated with biologic therapies were estimated using epidemiological data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of varying key parameters, including treatment-switching probability, product rebate, major rates of adverse drug reaction, and ACR20 rates, on the model outcomes. ### results tofacitinib combination therapy after MTX failure was associated with the lowest cost per member per month (PMPM) over a 2-year time frame at $5.53, compared with $6.49 for adalimumab, $6.43 for etanercept, $5.95 for certolizumab, and $5.89 for tocilizumab. Similar savings were observed when all biologics were administered as monotherapy. Tofacitinib combination therapy was also associated with the lower PMPM cost compared with adalimumab combination therapy in the TNF-IR analysis . tofacitinib was also among the lowest cost per ACR20 responder in each analysis. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that tofacitinib would potentially be cost saving even in the least optimistic scenarios. ### conclusions This analysis suggests that tofacitinib 5 mg BID following MTX failure is a lower cost per patient treatment option when used either as monotherapy or combination therapy, compared with adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab and tocilizumab biologic regimens. tofacitinib + MTX in TNF-IR patients was also predicted to be a lower-cost treatment option compared with adalimumab+MTX and was associated with the lowest cost per ACR 20/50/70 responder. ### disclosures This study was funded by Pfizer, which determined the research topic and paid York Health Economics Consortium to develop the analysis and conduct the research.

The first interim analysis of the KEYNOTE-426 study showed superior efficacy of pembrolizumab plus axitinib over sunitinib monotherapy in treatment-naive, advanced renal cell carcinoma. The exploratory analysis with extended follow-up reported here aims to assess long-term efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib monotherapy in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. ### methods In the ongoing, randomised, open-label, phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 study, adults (≥18 years old) with treatment-naive, advanced renal cell carcinoma with clear cell histology were enrolled in 129 sites (hospitals and cancer centres) across 16 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles plus 5 mg axitinib orally twice daily or 50 mg sunitinib monotherapy orally once daily for 4 weeks per 6-week cycle. Randomisation was done using an interactive voice response system or integrated web response system, and was stratified by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk status and geographical region. Primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Since the primary endpoints were met at the first interim analysis, updated data are reported with nominal p values. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02853331. ### findings Between Oct 24 , 2016 , and Jan 24 , 2018 , 861 patients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab plus axitinib ( n=432 ) or sunitinib monotherapy ( n=429 ) . With a median follow-up of 30·6 months (IQR 27·2-34·2), continued clinical benefit was observed with pembrolizumab plus axitinib over sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached with pembrolizumab and axitinib vs 35·7 months [95% CI 33·3-not reached] with sunitinib); hazard ratio [HR] 0·68 [95% CI 0·55-0·85], p=0·0003) and progression-free survival (median 15·4 months [12·7-18·9] vs 11·1 months [9·1-12·5]; 0·71 [0·60-0·84], p<0·0001). The most frequent (≥10% patients in either group) treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse events were hypertension (95 [22%] of 429 patients in the pembrolizumab plus axitinib group vs 84 [20%] of 425 patients in the sunitinib group), alanine aminotransferase increase (54 [13%] vs 11 [3%]), and diarrhoea (46 [11%] vs 23 [5%]). No new treatment-related deaths were reported since the first interim analysis. ### interpretation With extended study follow-up, results from KEYNOTE-426 show that pembrolizumab plus axitinib continues to have superior clinical outcomes over sunitinib. These results continue to support the first-line treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib as the standard of care of advanced renal cell carcinoma. ### funding Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, a subsidiary of Merck & Co, Inc.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33284113/", "doc_id": "3d0d59d4e485f6a55293b551396a97b1"}

Without treatment, patients with inoperable or metastatic colorectal cancer have a median life expectancy of about 8 months. The following article is an update of our 2005 review of chemotherapy regimens used in metastatic colorectal cancer, based on the standard Prescrire methodology. In 2005, the de Gramont protocol, based on fluorouracil (always combined with folinic acid) plus either oxaliplatin (Folfox protocol) or irinotecan (Folfiri protocol), was the standard first-line chemotherapy in this setting. Four trials comparing monotherapy versus combination therapy in previously untreated patients showed that initial fluorouracil (or fluorouracil precursor) monotherapy, followed by the Folfox or Folfiri protocol in case of failure, was not associated with shorter overall survival. Two trials compared first-line treatment with the Folfiri regimen versus the Folfoxiri regimen (fluorouracil + oxaliplatin + irinotecan). One of these studies showed an increase in median survival with the Folfoxiri protocol (24 versus 17 months), but at a cost of greater neurotoxicity. The only tangible advantage of capecitabine and tegafur, two oral fluorouracil precursors, is their convenience of use. pemetrexed was less effective and more toxic than the Folfiri protocol in one trial. bevacizumab and panitumumab have yielded disappointing results in previously untreated patients. Neither of these monoclonal antibodies has yet been shown to improve overall survival. Three trials have assessed the addition of cetuximab to combinations consisting of fluorouracil or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin or irinotecan. In two of these trials, the median survival time of patients whose tumours carried the wild-type KRAS gene was about 3 months longer in the cetuximab arms, although the increase was statistically significant in only one trial. cetuximab had no impact on survival time in the third trial. In two trials , an anti-EGFR antibody ( panitumumab or cetuximab ) reduced median survival when added to bevacizumab in previously untreated patients . When progression occurs after treatment with the Folfiri protocol (or equivalent), a combination of the Folfox protocol and bevacizumab seems to increase median survival time by about 2 months versus Folfox alone, but it is also more toxic. In patients who progress after receiving the fluorouracil + oxaliplatin combination (Folfox) or the fluorouracil+ irinotecan combination (Folfiri), neither panitumumab nor cetuximab has been shown to provide a clinically meaningful increase in overall survival. It remains to be shown whether these drugs are more effective in patients with the wild-type KRAS gene than in patients with KRAS mutations. In early 2010, the standard cytotoxic drugs for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer are fluorouracil (combined with folinic acid), oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Initial combination therapy may be beneficial when the metastases are borderline operable. When the metastases are inoperable and are unlikely to become operable after chemotherapy, it seems best to begin treatment with single-agent fluorouracil (+ folinic acid) or capecitabine. The use of monoclonal antibodies in first-line treatment of patients with colorectal cancer is not justified. Further trials of these drugs are warranted as second-line treatment for patients with KRAS wild-type tumours.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21180382/", "doc_id": "842c481f52d8e56971342febee357ad0"}

All patients had topical moisturizer coapplied to both sides of the face, and received oral minocycline. The primary endpoint was the difference in total facial lesion count of acne-like rash at 4 weeks. Secondary endpoints included complete control rate (CCR) of acne-like rash (≤5 facial lesions) and global skin assessment (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] scale, grade 0-4) at 4 weeks. Two blinded dermatologists independently evaluated the endpoints from photographs. ### results A total of 36 patients were enrolled, of whom 26 were evaluable. adapalene treatment was associated with a greater lesion count than placebo at 4 weeks, although the difference was not statistically significant (mean, 12.6 vs. 9.8, ### conclusion adapalene is not recommended as prophylaxis against acne-like rash induced by anti-EGFR therapies.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30890624/", "doc_id": "32d6f9ea24ebefa67b7f337223591178"}

Combination hormonal therapy, comprising a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa) with an antiandrogen, is widely used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

The pivotal consideration is whether there are adequate benefits with combination hormonal therapy in terms of increased survival and decreased disease progression to outweigh the increased risk of adverse events and additional cost. The most recent meta-analysis by the Prostate Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group indicates a small but statistically significant survival benefit with combination hormonal therapy using nonsteroidal antiandrogens.

In this work, we first designed a pertuzumab plant biosimilar (PPB) and investigated the composition of its Asn297-linked glycan in comparison with trastuzumab plant biosimilar (TPB). Both biosimilars were produced in wild-type (WT) Nicotiana benthamiana plant (PPB-WT and TPB-WT) and transgenic ΔXTFT N. benthamiana plant with XT and FT genes knockout (PPB-ΔXTFT and TPB-ΔXTFT).

Hepatitis C virus infection affects around 3% of the world population or approximately 160 million people. A variable proportion (5% to 40%) of the infected people develop clinical symptoms. Hence, hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality with hepatic fibrosis, end-stage liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma as the dominant clinical sequelae. Combination therapy with pegylated (peg) interferon-alpha and ribavirin achieves sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment) in approximately 40% to 80% of treated patients, depending on viral genotype. Recently, a new class of drugs have emerged for hepatitis C infection, the direct acting antivirals, which in combination with standard therapy or alone can lead to sustained virological response in 80% or more of treated patients. Aminoadamantanes, mostly amantadine, are antiviral drugs used for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. We have previously systematically reviewed amantadine versus placebo or no intervention and found no significant effects of the amantadine on all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and on adverse events in patients with hepatitis C. Overall, we did not observe a significant effect of amantadine on sustained virological response. In this review, we systematically review aminoadamantanes versus other antiviral drugs. ### objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of aminoadamantanes versus other antiviral drugs for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection by conducting a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials. ### Search Methods The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (1996 to December 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11 of 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to December 2013), EMBASE (1974 to December 2013), Science Citation Index EXPANDED (1900 to December 2013), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp), Google Scholar, and Eudrapharm up to December 2013. Furthermore, full text searches were conducted until December 2013. ### Selection Criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing aminoadamantanes in participants with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. ### Data Collection And Analysis Two authors independently extracted data. RevMan Analysis was used for statistical analysis of dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Methodological domains were used to assess the risk of systematic errors ('bias'). We used trial sequential analysis to assess risk of random errors ('play of chance'). ### Main Results Six randomised clinical trials with 581 participants with chronic hepatitis C were included. All trials had high risk of bias. The included trials compared amantadine versus other antiviral drugs: ribavirin, mycophenolate mofetil, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma. Standard antiviral therapy (interferon-alpha, interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, or peg interferon alpha) was administered equally to the intervention and the control groups in five trials, depending on when the trial was conducted. Four trials compared amantadine versus ribavirin. There were no deaths or liver-related morbidity in the two intervention groups (0/216 (0%) versus 0/211 (0%); 4 trials; very low quality of the evidence). The lower estimated risk for (serious) adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation with amantadine was imprecise (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.16; based on 10/216 (5%) versus 18/211 (9%) participants in 4 trials; very low quality of the evidence). There were more participants with failure of sustained virological response in the amantadine group than in the ribavirin group (206/216 (96%) versus 176/211 (84%); RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22, 4 trials; low quality of the evidence). amantadine versus ribavirin more often failed to achieve end-of follow-up biochemical response (41/46 (89%) versus 31/46 (67%); RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.63; 2 trials; very low quality of the evidence). One trial compared amantadine versus mycophenolate mofetil. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups , except that amantadine was inferior to mycophenolate mofetil regarding the outcome failure to achieve end-of treatment virological response ( low quality of evidence ) . One trial each compared amantadine versus interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma. Both comparisons showed no significant differences in the treatment outcomes (very low quality of the evidence). The observed effects could be due to real effects, systematic errors (bias), or random errors (play of chance). This possible influence on the observed effect by play of chance is due to the fact that trial sequential analyses could not confirm our findings. We were not able to perform meta-analyses on failure of histological improvement and quality of life due to lack of valid data in all trial comparisons. ### Authors Conclusions This systematic review has identified evidence of very low quality for the key outcomes of all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and adverse events in people with chronic hepatitis C when treated with amantadine compared with ribavirin, mycophenolate, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma. The timeframe for measuring the composite outcome was insufficient in the included trials. There was low quality evidence that amantadine led to more participants who failed to achieve sustained virological response compared with ribavirin. This observation may be real or caused by systematic errors (bias), but it does not seem to be caused by random error (play of chance). Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are unable to determine definitively whether amantadine is less effective than other antivirals in patients with chronic hepatitis C. As it appears less likely that future trials assessing amantadine or potentially other aminoadamantanes for patients with chronic hepatitis C would show strong benefits, it is probably better to focus on the assessments of other direct acting antiviral drugs. We found no evidence assessing other aminoadamantanes in randomised clinical trials in order to recommend or refute their use.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24937404/", "doc_id": "7bd97010e6ca716490f2fe6f366d14b6"}

However, dexamethasone given in the absence of food had no effect on serum leptin at 10 hours. The present experiment was undertaken to determine the duration of the effect of dexamethasone on 24-hour serum leptin under fasted and fed conditions in humans. ### Research Methods And Procedures Six healthy non-obese male volunteers were studied under the following four conditions: 1) dexamethasone (2 mg intravenously, given at 0900 hours) with fasting; 2) dexamethasone with food (1,700 kcal, 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 30% fat, given in one meal 2 hours after dexamethasone administration at 1100 hours); 3) saline with food (same meal); 4) saline with fasting. Serum leptin, glucose, insulin, and cortisol were monitored every 30 minutes for 24 hours. ### results 1) Under the fasting condition, dexamethasone increased leptin nocturnal secretion between 2100 and 2400 hours. 2) A single meal (1,700 kcal) at 1100 hours increased nocturnal leptin secretion when compared with the fasting condition. The peak increase of leptin was 123% over baseline between 2100 and 2400 hours, 10 to 14 hours after the meal. 3) In the fed + dexamethasone condition, leptin levels increased from baseline starting 8 hours after dexamethasone injection, reached a maximum increase of 260% between 2100 and 2400 hours, then decreased thereafter, remaining elevated compared to baseline for 16 hours. There was a correlation between 24-hour leptin secretion and insulin secretion after a single morning meal. ### discussion A single bolus of dexamethasone , given before a single large meal , produces a delayed ( 6-hour ) but long-lasting increase in serum leptin ( over 16 hours ) .

Protocol therapy was either vandetanib 300 mg oral daily plus bicalutamide 50 mg oral daily (Arm A) or bicalutamide 50 mg oral daily alone (Arm B) with cross-over to vandetanib monotherapy at progression. The primary endpoint was PSA response (≥ 50 % decline from baseline). ### results Thirty-nine patients were recruited, 19 in Arm A and 20 in Arm B. PSA response was comparable in Arm A and Arm B (18 vs. 19 %). Time to PSA progression was 3.16 months (95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.09, not reached (NR)) for Arm A and 3.09 months (95 % CI: 1.22, NR) for Arm B. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was more common in Arm A compared to Arm B (42 vs. 5 %; p = 0.019). Treatment with vandetanib was associated with a reduction in soluble VEGFR-2 levels after two cycles but an increase in plasma VEGF levels. ### conclusion The combination of vandetanib and bicalutamide was associated with considerable toxicity and did not have superior efficacy over bicalutamide alone . Further evaluation of this combination is not warranted in mCRPC.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24671507/", "doc_id": "ac00391719a33cac85ce9aa4f853c2d6"}

Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) commonly occurs in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with PVTT usually have an aggressive disease course, decreased liver function reserve, limited treatment options, higher recurrence rates after treatment, and, therefore, worse overall survival. Among untreated HCC patients with PVTT, the median overall survival has been reported as low as 2 to 4 months. Historically, many aspects of PVTT have impacted the theoretical and practical safety and efficacy of treatment, for example, disordered blood flow and associated impairment of liver function, heat-sink effects of blood flow in the area of the PVTT, and risk of recurrence due to tumor location in the blood vessel. The current Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system categorizes HCC patients with PVTT as advanced stage, for which the standard of care is targeted therapy with sorafenib. However, sorafenib is associated with only marginal benefits among patients with PVTT. First-line lenvatinib , which was shown to be noninferior to sorafenib , excluded patients with main portal trunk invasion . regorafenib and nivolumab, an immune-based therapy, were recently approved in the United States for second-line therapy after sorafenib. Preliminary results for cabozantinib suggest a benefit in the second-/third-line after sorafenib failure. In addition, rapid advances in many fields (surgery, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine, and immunotherapy) have increased the potential treatment options for the management of this complex disease entity. A large portion of the emerging evidence focuses on the broader category of advanced HCC of which PVTT is a subgroup. While many of these studies show promising results, the efficacy among PVTT patients requires validation in prospective studies. Real-world data may help fill the evidence gap for patients not eligible for clinical trials due to common hepatic function requirements.

The first study showed 36 keloids (97.29%) softening after the first dose. In the second study, 5 showed different responses (the response was complete in the four smaller keloids). The largest keloid needed 9 doses to achieve an improvement of 70%. In conclusion , combined treatment with 0.375 IU of bleomycin and 4 mg of triamcinolone acetonide to 1 cm2 was considered to be an acceptable procedure for the treatment of keloids . The best results were obtained in keloids over 1 cm2 or when divided into 1 cm2 square areas.

Of all the IMiDs, clinical trial data are most mature for lenalidomide. In phase I studies, dose-limiting toxicities of lenalidomide were limited to myelosuppression and a response rate of 72% was seen in relapsed/refractory patients. Three phase II studies subsequently evaluated the efficacy of single-agent lenalidomide or lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone. As a single agent for post-transplant salvage therapy, lenalidomide 25 mg every 3 weeks has shown response rates as high as 44%. For patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, the MM-007 study has shown that lenalidomide alone or in combination with dexamethasone provides response rates between 37% and 41%. In MM-007, median progression-free survival was 5.5 months at early analysis and the median overall survival has yet to be reached. Preliminary data for the single-arm, multicenter, open-label MM-014 study showed that median time to progression was 5.6 months. Response rates indicate that 70% of patients had stable disease or better as the best response to treatment. Two randomized, phase III trials (MM-009 and MM-010) evaluated lenalidomide with high-dose dexamethasone versus high-dose dexamethasone alone for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Both MM-009 and MM-010 provided remarkably similar response rates for patients receiving lenalidomide and dexamethasone. In both trials response rates with the combination were greater than twice the response rates seen with high-dose dexamethasone alone. Indeed, an independent Data Monitoring Committee determined that both trials exceeded the prespecified efficacy value of P<.0015, recommending that the trials be discontinued and that lenalidomide be offered to patients on the dexamethasone arm of the trial if clinically indicated. Toxicities observed in studies of lenalidomide alone were low; the incidence of peripheral neuropathy was significantly lower than those noted in trials using thalidomide. Thrombocytopenia was a significant grade 3 or 4 toxicity observed; however, it was manageable with dose reduction. In contrast with high-dose dexamethasone, deep vein thrombosis has emerged as an important toxicity.

Chronic pain in the elderly is frequently a result of arthritic disorders, particularly osteoarthritis. The cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are as effective as standard NSAIDs for the relief of pain and for improving function in elderly patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of serious gastroduodenal adverse reactions but there is evidence that they carry a lower risk for these adverse effects than standard NSAIDs, except when there is concurrent aspirin use. Since gastroduodenal disorders are the most frequently reported serious adverse effects of NSAIDs and these disorders occur more frequently in the elderly, COX-2 inhibitors offer an alternative to standard NSAIDs in this age group. However, they are not appropriate for many patients with cardiovascular and renal disease. The adverse reaction profile of the COX-2 inhibitors has confirmed the role of the COX-2 enzyme in renal function, salt and water homeostasis and the vascular endothelium. Thus, like standard NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause renal failure, hypertension and exacerbation of cardiac failure. Of note is that these disorders are dose related. Thus, there are good reasons to avoid high doses of COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly. Clinical trials indicate that daily doses of rofecoxib 12.5 mg, celecoxib 100-200 mg, valdecoxib 10mg and etoricoxib 60 mg are the minimum effective doses of these agents. Data from the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme indicate that celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day are/were the most commonly prescribed doses and that 6 % of patients had taken rofecoxib 50 mg/day for longer than recommended . Recent research indicates that COX-2 inhibitors have a thrombotic potential, especially in high doses and when use is prolonged, and this further limits the extent to which they can be used in the elderly. Important interactions with COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly include those with warfarin, which can result in loss of control of anticoagulation, and those with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists and diuretics, which can result in loss of control of blood pressure and cardiac failure and, in hypovolaemic conditions, renal failure. The clinical significance of an interaction between celecoxib and aspirin to reduce the antiplatelet effect of the latter drug is unknown. Preliminary information from spontaneous reporting systems indicates that there may be differences in the risk of cardiac failure and hypertension between standard NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors and between rofecoxib and celecoxib. More formal studies using equivalent doses are needed to test this observation. Use of COX-2 inhibitors may be considered in the elderly to reduce the risk of gastroduodenal complications associated with standard NSAIDs but only when consideration has first been given to use of less toxic medicines as alternatives or supplements, the appropriate dose of the COX-2 inhibitor or standard NSAID, the presence and possible impact of co-morbidities, and the implications of taking COX-2 inhibitors with any concomitant medications. Equally important is regular monitoring of the patient taking a COX-2 inhibitor for efficacy and adverse effects, and ensuring that the patient has a continuing need to keep taking the drug. Close attention also needs to be paid to intercurrent illnesses and new prescriptions that may reduce the safety of the COX-2 inhibitor. A standard NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor may be equally effective as a COX-2 inhibitor in reducing the risk of gastroduodenal toxicity and if used the same prescribing advice applies. Current knowledge concerning the thrombotic potential of COX-2 inhibitors suggests that this combination, if tolerated, may be preferable to a COX-2 inhibitor, particularly where prolonged use is required. This knowledge also indicates that for patients with or at high risk of ischaemic heart disease or stroke, COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15813652/", "doc_id": "3ed64085bfe928c461f9c17f9f8f5ac1"}

A significant amount of AA is liberated in the presence of 2 mM EGTA, independently of Ca2+, primarily from phosphatidic acid and polyphosphoinositides (poly-PI). Quinacrine, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), suppressed AA release by about 60% and neomycin, a putative inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC), reduced AA release by about 30%. An additive effect was exhibited when both inhibitors were given together. Ca2+ activated AA release. The level of Ca2+ present in the synaptoneurosomal preparation (endogenous level) and 5 microM CaCl2 enhance AA liberation by approximately 25%, whereas 2 mM CaCl2 resulted in a 50% increase in AA release relative to EGTA. The source for Ca(2+)-dependent AA release is predominantly phosphatidylinositol (PI); however, a small pool may also be liberated from neutral lipids. carbachol, an agonist of the cholinergic receptor, stimulated Ca(2+)-dependent AA release by about 17%.

Cancer is second most common cause of death in the United State. There are over 100 different types of cancer associated with different human organs, predominantly breast, liver, pancreas, prostate, colon, rectum, lung, and stomach. We have recently reported properties of pro-inflammatory (for treatment of various types of cancers), and anti-inflammatory (for cardiovascular disease and diabetes) compounds. The major problem associated with development of anticancer drugs is their lack of solubility in aqueous solutions and severe side effects in cancer patients. Therefore, the present study was carried out to check anticancer properties of selected compounds, mostly aqueous soluble, in cancer cell lines from different organs. ### methods The anticancer properties, anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptotic activity of novel naturally occurring or FDA approved, nontoxic, proteasome inhibitors/activators were compared. In addition to that, effect of δ-tocotrienol on expression of proteasome subunits (X, Y, Z, LMP7, LMP2, LMP10), ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and TNF-α using total RNAs derived from plasmas of hepatitis C patients was investigated. ### results Our data demonstrated that following compounds are very effective in inducing apoptosis of cancer cells: Thiostrepton, dexamethasone, 2-methoxyestradiol, δ-tocotrienol, quercetin, amiloride, and quinine sulfate have significant anti-proliferation properties in Hela cells (44% - 87%) with doses of 2.5-20 μM, compared to respective controls.

A dose level was considered acceptable if, of the first six eligible patients on each cohort, fewer than three experienced dose limiting toxicities. ### results Sequence B of this 2 sequence \"ping-pong\" trial closed early due to toxicity in cohort 2 (gemcitabine 300 mg/m/wk and paclitaxel 30 mg/m/wk). On Sequence A, the MTD was the cohort 5 dose: gemcitabine 450 mg/m/wk and carboplatin 2 area under curve (AUC) concurrently with thoracic radiation. Cohort 7 ( gemcitabine 600 mg/m/wk and carboplatin 2 AUC ) showed 4 dose limiting toxicities : 2 grade 3 esophagitis ; one grade 3 febrile neutropenia ; and one grade 4 neutropenia . ### conclusion Concurrent gemcitabine/paclitaxel chemoradiation regimen followed by adjuvant gemcitabine/carboplatin produced excessive toxicity at the lowest tested dose combination and was not suitable for further study in this trial. Meanwhile, the MTD of concurrent gemcitabine/carboplatin chemoradiation was determined to be gemcitabine 450 mg/m and carboplatin AUC-2. This combination was found to be tolerable.

Since the mid-2000s, the field of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has experienced a paradigm shift from non-specific therapy with broad-acting cytokines to specific regimens, which directly target the cancer, the tumour microenvironment, or both.Current guidelines recommend targeted therapies with agents such as sunitinib, pazopanib or temsirolimus (for people with poor prognosis) as the standard of care for first-line treatment of people with mRCC and mention non-specific cytokines as an alternative option for selected patients.In November 2015, nivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor directed against programmed death-1 (PD-1), was approved as the first specific immunotherapeutic agent as second-line therapy in previously treated mRCC patients. ### objectives To assess the effects of immunotherapies either alone or in combination with standard targeted therapies for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and their efficacy to maximize patient benefit. ### Search Methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ISI Web of Science and registers of ongoing clinical trials in November 2016 without language restrictions. We scanned reference lists and contacted experts in the field to obtain further information. ### Selection Criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs with or without blinding involving people with mRCC. ### Data Collection And Analysis We collected and analyzed studies according to the published protocol. Summary statistics for the primary endpoints were risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MD) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We rated the quality of evidence using GRADE methodology and summarized the quality and magnitude of relative and absolute effects for each primary outcome in our 'Summary of findings' tables. ### Main Results We identified eight studies with 4732 eligible participants and an additional 13 ongoing studies. We categorized studies into comparisons, all against standard therapy accordingly as first-line (five comparisons) or second-line therapy (one comparison) for mRCC.Interferon (IFN)-α monotherapy probably increases one-year overall mortality compared to standard targeted therapies with temsirolimus or sunitinib (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.51; 2 studies; 1166 participants; moderate-quality evidence), may lead to similar quality of life (QoL) (e.g. MD -5.58 points, 95% CI -7.25 to -3.91 for Functional Assessment of Cancer - General (FACT-G); 1 study; 730 participants; low-quality evidence) and may slightly increase the incidence of adverse events (AEs) grade 3 or greater (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32; 1 study; 408 participants; low-quality evidence).There is probably no difference between IFN-α plus temsirolimus and temsirolimus alone for one-year overall mortality (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.34; 1 study; 419 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but the incidence of AEs of 3 or greater may be increased (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.45; 1 study; 416 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no information on QoL.IFN-α alone may slightly increase one-year overall mortality compared to IFN-α plus bevacizumab (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.36; 2 studies; 1381 participants; low-quality evidence). This effect is probably accompanied by a lower incidence of AEs of grade 3 or greater (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84; 2 studies; 1350 participants; moderate-quality evidence). QoL could not be evaluated due to insufficient data. Treatment with IFN-α plus bevacizumab or standard targeted therapy ( sunitinib ) may lead to similar one-year overall mortality ( RR 0.37 , 95 % CI 0.13 to 1.08 ; 1 study ; 83 participants ; low-quality evidence ) and AEs of grade 3 or greater ( RR 1.18 , 95 % CI 0.85 to 1.62 ; 1 study ; 82 participants ; low-quality evidence ) . QoL could not be evaluated due to insufficient data.Treatment with vaccines (e.g. MVA-5T4 or IMA901) or standard therapy may lead to similar one-year overall mortality (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.32; low-quality evidence) and AEs of grade 3 or greater (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.39; 2 studies; 1065 participants; low-quality evidence). QoL could not be evaluated due to insufficient data.In previously treated patients, targeted immunotherapy (nivolumab) probably reduces one-year overall mortality compared to standard targeted therapy with everolimus (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.87; 1 study; 821 participants; moderate-quality evidence), probably improves QoL (e.g. RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.78 for clinically relevant improvement of the FACT-Kidney Symptom Index Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS); 1 study, 704 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and probably reduces the incidence of AEs grade 3 or greater (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.65; 1 study; 803 participants; moderate-quality evidence). ### Authors Conclusions Evidence of moderate quality demonstrates that IFN-α monotherapy increases mortality compared to standard targeted therapies alone, whereas there is no difference if IFN is combined with standard targeted therapies. Evidence of low quality demonstrates that QoL is worse with IFN alone and that severe AEs are increased with IFN alone or in combination. There is low-quality evidence that IFN-α alone increases mortality but moderate-quality evidence on decreased AEs compared to IFN-α plus bevacizumab. Low-quality evidence shows no difference for IFN-α plus bevacizumab compared to sunitinib with respect to mortality and severe AEs. Low-quality evidence demonstrates no difference of vaccine treatment compared to standard targeted therapies in mortality and AEs, whereas there is moderate-quality evidence that targeted immunotherapies reduce mortality and AEs and improve QoL.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28504837/", "doc_id": "8e05f49203e45d0f5d18bf08087c48a2"}

Induction of regulatory T cells (Treg) is an important mechanism leading to tolerance against tumors.

Our study aimed to analyze the influence of sorafenib and sunitinib on the frequency of Treg in patients with metastatic RCC ( mRCC ) . Treg were analyzed by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood (PB) of patients (n=19) with histologically confirmed mRCC under treatment with either sunitinib (50 mg/d, n=11) or sorafenib (800 mg/d, n=8). Blood samples were taken before treatment and during the first, second, and third months of therapy. Flow cytometric analysis of PB mononuclear cells was performed using fluorochrome-labeled antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD25, and FOXp3. During the first month of therapy, patients treated with sorafenib showed a significant increase in FOXp3CD3CD4CD25 Treg (13.5 vs. 36.3% of gated cells, P=0.02, or 0.35 vs. 0.49% of total cells) and the ratio FOXp3 T cells/FOXp3 T cells (0.16 vs. 0.56 of gated cells, P=0.02). These elevated levels persisted throughout the treatment period. There was no influence of sunitinib on the frequency of Treg in our cohort of patients. sorafenib, but not sunitinib, leads to an early and sustained increase in Treg in PB of mRCC patients. In immunoresponsive tumors such as RCC, immunological effects of kinase inhibitors are particularly relevant for the design of combination trials with immunotherapeutic agents. Our study suggests that sorafenib should be avoided in such a therapeutic setting.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22156795/", "doc_id": "aed14eca85db89b8b0b3d86c37c2081b"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether tri-weekly modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) maintenance chemotherapy is associated with a low incidence of severe hematologic and neurologic toxicities in the treatment of patients with metastatic CRC. ### methodology We developed a new treatment regimen with mFOLFOX6 biweekly for 8-10 consecutive cycles (induction phase) followed by a 3-week rest period, after which treatment was resumed with cycles of tri-weekly mFOLFOX6 at standard doses (maintenance phase). Validity and complications were investigated retrospectively. ### results Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in this study. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times were 9.4 months and 23 months, respectively. All patients had peripheral neuropathy during treatment, but grade 3 neurotoxicity was observed in only 2 patients (6.9%). ### conclusions mFOLFOX6 maintenance chemotherapy was associated with a very low incidence of grade 3 hematologic and neurologic toxicities. The toxicities associated with PFS and OS were comparable to those reported in the treatment of patients with metastatic CRC. A tri-weekly mFOLFOX maintenance strategy of alternative treatment with a less-toxic regimen may reduce toxicity and maintain efficacy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22234064/", "doc_id": "293b50fc8d6d4c34305176b415115cb6"}

The three patterns of results were also obtained with NVB/TXT combinations. For the synergistic combinations at the lowest concentrations, cytotoxicity occurred by apoptosis following mitosis. For differentiated cells, the most cytotoxic combinations were 1 microM TAX or TXT for 3 days followed by 1 microM NVB for 3 days, and 0.75 nM TAX or TXT for 9 days followed by 1 microM NVB for 3 days, the latter producing synergistic effects.

According to these margins, triple therapy based on any NOAC proved to be superior to dual therapy alone, but at the same time demonstrated its equivalence with dual therapy. The results for apixaban-based triple therapy were inconclusive (not superior, not not-inferior, not equivalent and, of course, not inferior to the controls).

This study examines whether the regulations impacted methamphetamine arrests. ### design ARIMA-intervention time-series analysis with control series. ### setting California (1982-2001). ### measurements Dependent variable series: monthly methamphetamine arrests. Control series: monthly marijuana arrests and cocaine/heroin arrests. ### interventions Bulk powder ephedrine and pseudoephedrine: regulated November 1989. Products containing ephedrine as the single active medicinal ingredient: regulated August 1995. pseudoephedrine products: regulated October 1997. Large-scale producers used ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in these forms. Ephedrine combined with other active medicinal ingredients (e.g. various cold medicines)-used mainly by small-scale producers: regulated October 1996. ### findings The regulation targeting small-scale producers (1996) had no significant impact. In contrast, methamphetamine arrests stopped rising and dropped 31% to 45% each of the three times precursor chemicals used by large-scale producers were regulated. Within 3 years of the bulk powder regulation (1989) and again within 2 years of the ephedrine single ingredient regulation (1995), arrests fully rebounded. During the 4 years following the last regulation (pseudoephedrine products, 1997) arrests only partially rebounded. These effects parallel those reported on hospital admissions.

The purpose of the present study was to confirm this interaction in vitro. ### methods A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to assay 4-chlorophenylbiguanide (4-CPBG) and cycloguanil formed from proguanil by microsomes prepared from human liver. The limit of detection was 0.08 nmol mg-'. h-I. ### results The formation of 4-CPBG and cycloguanil could be described by one-enzyme kinetics, indicating that the formation of the two metabolites is almost exclusively catalysed by a single enzyme, i.e. CYP2C19 within the concentration range used, or that the contribution of an alternative low-affinity enzyme, probably CYP3A4, is very low. This notion was confirmed by the lack of potent inhibition by four CYP3A4 inhibitors: ketoconazole, bromocriptine, midazolam and dihydroergotamine. fluvoxamine was a very effective inhibitor of the oxidation of proguanil, displaying Ki values of 0.69 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of cycloguanil formation and 4.7 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of 4-CPBG formation. As expected, the CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole inhibited the formation of both metabolites with an IC50 of 10 micromol x l(-1). Norfluoxetine and sulfaphenazole inhibited proguanil oxidation with Ki values of 7.3-16 micromol x l(-1), suggesting that the two compounds are moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19. ### conclusions Fluvoxamine is a fairly potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and it has the potential for causing drug-drug interactions with substrates for CYP2C19 such as imipramine , clomipramine , amitriptyline and diazepam .

Therefore, treatment should be easy to administer on an outpatient basis. We explored a novel combination therapy avoiding platinum. Patients with recurrent or metastatic NSCLC were treated with intravenous (i.v.) topotecan (0.5-1.0 mg/m(2)/day x 5) and i.v. vinorelbine (20-30 mg/m(2)/day on day 1 and day 5) in 21-day cycles. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined separately with or without the addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. Twenty-nine patients have been enrolled to date. At i.v. topotecan doses of 0.75-1.0 mg/m(2)/day and i.v. vinorelbine of 25 mg/m(2)/day, neutropenia was frequent but of short duration (<7 days). The DLT of i.v. topotecan (0.85 mg/m(2)) in the absence of G-CSF support was based on myelosuppression with neutropenic fever. With the addition of G-CSF, a DLT has not been reached. Nonhematologic toxicities included mild to moderate fatigue and constipation. An overall clinical response rate of 42% was achieved, with responses noted at all dose levels. At a short median follow-up of 15 months, the median survival for all patients is 13 months. In conclusion, the combination regimen of topotecan and vinorelbine is feasible for outpatient administration and is well tolerated with less toxicity than platinum-based regimens. Preliminary response data demonstrate good tumor activity, suggesting that this regimen could make an excellent palliative treatment for advanced NSCLC.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11598413/", "doc_id": "a0ac50dcdd622cfc2511df4110f4c9c2"}

Additionally, atenolol and metoprolol were evaluated to see whether differential delivery to the brain contributed to the observed lack of effect of systemically administered beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists. ICV administration of pindolol (45 or 90 micrograms) was followed by a suppression of copulation.

It is impossible to unravel such problems without using a systems approach, i.e. focussing on processes, not just molecular components. This inevitably involves modelling as the interactions require quantitative analysis. Modelling is a tool of analysis aimed at understanding, first, and predicting, eventually.

We demonstrate that mathematical models are beneficial for unravelling the complex interactions of pharmacodynamics in the heart.

At all concentration levels there was a statistically significant difference between the treatments, with the highest release of endotoxin per killed bacterium for cefuroxime, lower for tobramycin and the lowest for the combination of the two drugs (P < 0.001). With increasing doses, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the propensity to release endotoxin.

This reduction in endotoxin release was not caused by an unspecific endotoxin binding of tobramycin. ### conclusions Addition of tobramycin reduced the cefuroxime-induced endotoxin release per killed bacterium to a level which was even lower than that of tobramycin alone in spite of an increased killing rate.

HQL was assessed before treatment initiation and then every 3 weeks using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Module-Prostate 14 (QOLM-P14), a trial-specific module developed for this study. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to determine the mean duration of HQL improvement and differences in improvement duration between groups of patients. ### results At 6 weeks, both groups showed improvement in several HQL domains, and only physical functioning and pain were better in the mitoxantrone-plus-prednisone group than in the prednisone-alone group. After 6 weeks, patients taking prednisone showed no improvement in HQL scores, whereas those taking mitoxantrone plus prednisone showed significant improvements in global quality of life (P =.009), four functioning domains, and nine symptoms (.001 < P <. 01), and the improvement (> 10 units on a scale of 0 to100) lasted longer than in the prednisone-alone group (.004 < P <.05). The addition of mitoxantrone to prednisone after failure of prednisone alone was associated with improvements in pain, pain impact, pain relief, insomnia, and global quality of life (.001 < P <.003). ### conclusion Treatment with mitoxantrone plus prednisone was associated with greater and longer-lasting improvement in several HQL domains and symptoms than treatment with prednisone alone.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10561201/", "doc_id": "0988f1d7dca388570b1b818609c4a80e"}

These agents were investigated in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first-line setting. ### methods The systematic review was executed on January 27, 2015, and updated on August 21, 2016, using a pre-specified search strategy. Searches were conducted using PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE, with supplemental searches using the Evidence Based Medicine Reviews and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs published in English from 1995-2016 and reporting at least one of the primary outcomes [overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, or quality of life] in patients who received first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool, respectively. A Baysian network meta-analysis was performed on the primary outcomes. Hazard ratios (HRs) were evaluated for the primary analysis; secondary analyses were conducted using median OS data.

Eight studies connected to a common network for the OS analysis using HR data. The majority of studies were not limited to squamous NSCLC, thus analyzable data were limited to a subset of data within the published trials. carboplatin + S-1 and necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin were associated with lower HRs for OS versus all other comparators.

The majority of glioblastomas have aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways and malignant glioma cells are thought to be addicted to these signaling pathways for their survival and proliferation. However, recent studies suggest that monotherapies or inappropriate combination therapies using the molecular targeted drugs have limited efficacy possibly because of tumor heterogeneities, signaling redundancy and crosstalk in intracellular signaling network, indicating necessity of rationale and methods for efficient personalized combination treatments. Here, we evaluated the growth of colonies obtained from glioma tumor-initiating cells (GICs) derived from glioma sphere culture (GSC) in agarose and examined the effects of combination treatments on GICs using targeted drugs that affect the signaling pathways to which most glioma cells are addicted. ### methods Human GICs were cultured in agarose and treated with inhibitors of RTKs, non-receptor kinases or transcription factors. The colony number and volume were analyzed using a colony counter, and Chou-Talalay combination indices were evaluated. Autophagy and apoptosis were also analyzed. Phosphorylation of proteins was evaluated by reverse phase protein array and immunoblotting. ### results Increases of colony number and volume in agarose correlated with the Gompertz function. GICs showed diverse drug sensitivity, but inhibitions of RTK and RAF/MEK or PI3K by combinations such as EGFR inhibitor and MEK inhibitor, sorafenib and U0126, erlotinib and BKM120, and EGFR inhibitor and sorafenib showed synergy in different subtypes of GICs.

Given this activity, it seemed logical to attempt to combine paclitaxel with doxorubicin, the other most active single agent in metastatic breast cancer. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performed two trials investigating paclitaxel/doxorubicin combinations in patients with advanced breast cancer in an attempt to identify a tolerable dose and schedule of the combination. In the first trial , paclitaxel and doxorubicin were alternated every 3 weeks in doses of 200 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 , respectively , for patients who had received no more than one prior chemotherapeutic regimen . Therapy was well tolerated in this setting. At these doses, paclitaxel induced more granulocytopenia and less thrombocytopenia than did doxorubicin. Objective responses (complete and partial responses) were seen in seven of 12 patients; two other patients had improved disease (relief of pain in bony metastases). A second limited-institution Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial evaluated paclitaxel and doxorubicin given in combination. In this phase I trial, doxorubicin was given as an intravenous push and paclitaxel as a 24-hour continuous infusion. The sequence of drug administration (D-->P or P-->D) was alternated both between and within patients, so that we might evaluate the effect of administration schedule on toxicity. Therapy was begun at an initial paclitaxel dose of 150 mg/m2 and an initial doxorubicin dose of 50 mg/m2 in six patients, with a subsequent six patients receiving 175 and 60 mg/m2, respectively, of paclitaxel and doxorubicin. In addition, patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d. While therapy at the initial dose level was well tolerated, dose-limiting mucositis was seen at the second dose level, although only when paclitaxel preceded doxorubicin. This suggests that sequence of drug administration in paclitaxel-based regimens may play an important role as a determinant of toxicity and (perhaps) efficacy, a finding similar to that seen when paclitaxel and cisplatin were combined in patients with ovarian cancer. Based on this study, we identified the sequence of doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) followed by paclitaxel (150 mg/m2) to be the maximum tolerated dose.

The initial response ( IR ) was sustained for a mean ( s.d . ) of 309 ( 244 ) days with vildagliptin versus 270 ( 223 ) days for glimepiride ( p < 0.001 ) ( IR = nadir HbA1c where change from baseline > or = 0.5 % or HbA1c < or = 6.5 % within the first six months of treatment . After IR was detected, sustained response = time between nadir and an increase of >0.3% above IR). Independent of disease duration, age was a predictor of effect sustainability. Fewer patients experienced hypoglycaemia with vildagliptin (2.3% vs. 18.2% with glimepiride) with a 14-fold difference in the number of hypoglycaemic events (59 vs. 838). vildagliptin had a beneficial effect on body weight [mean (s.e.) change from baseline -0.3 (0.1) kg; between-group difference -1.5 kg; p < 0.001]. Overall, both treatments were well tolerated and displayed similar safety profiles. ### conclusions vildagliptin add-on has similar efficacy to glimepiride after 2 years' treatment, with markedly reduced hypoglycaemia risk and no weight gain.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20649630/", "doc_id": "710177e4ab5628b7cf2962ce9a4347ee"}

Endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a rare disease that results from exposure to high levels of cortisol; Cushing's disease (CD) is the most frequent form of CS. Patients with CS suffer from a variety of comorbidities that increase the risk of mortality. Surgical resection of the disease-causing lesion is generally the first-line treatment of CS. However, some patients may not be eligible for surgery due to comorbidities, and approximately 25 % of patients, especially those with CD, have recurrent disease. For these patients, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors may control cortisol elevation and subsequent symptomatology. CS is rare overall, and clinical studies of adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors are often small and, in many cases, data are limited regarding the efficacy and safety of these treatments. Our aim was to better characterize the profiles of efficacy and safety of currently available adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, including drugs currently in development. ### methods We performed a systematic review of the literature regarding adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, focusing on novel drugs. ### results Currently available adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors , including ketoconazole , metyrapone , etomidate , and mitotane , have variable efficacy and significant side effects , and none are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CS . Therefore, there is a clear need for novel, prospectively studied agents that have greater efficacy and a low rate of adverse side effects. Efficacy and safety data of current and emerging adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, including osilodrostat (LCI699) and levoketoconazole (COR-003), show promising results that will have to be confirmed in larger-scale phase 3 studies (currently ongoing). ### conclusions The management of CS, and particularly CD, remains challenging.

A combination of haloperidol and methamphetamine led to a function similar to the saline control function. The leftward shift probably reflects an increase in the speed of an internal clock, and the rightward shift probably reflects a decrease in its speed.

Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer have persistent, long-term risk of breast-cancer recurrence and death. Therefore, trials assessing endocrine therapies for this patient population need extended follow-up. We present an update of efficacy outcomes in the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 study at 8·1 years median follow-up. ### methods BIG 1-98 is a randomised, phase 3, double-blind trial of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer that compares 5 years of tamoxifen or letrozole monotherapy, or sequential treatment with 2 years of one of these drugs followed by 3 years of the other. Randomisation was done with permuted blocks, and stratified according to the two-arm or four-arm randomisation option, participating institution, and chemotherapy use. Patients, investigators, data managers, and medical reviewers were masked. The primary efficacy endpoint was disease-free survival (events were invasive breast cancer relapse, second primaries [contralateral breast and non-breast], or death without previous cancer event). Secondary endpoints were overall survival, distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), and breast cancer-free interval (BCFI). The monotherapy comparison included patients randomly assigned to tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years. In 2005 , after a significant disease-free survival benefit was reported for letrozole as compared with tamoxifen , a protocol amendment facilitated the crossover to letrozole of patients who were still receiving tamoxifen alone ; Cox models and Kaplan-Meier estimates with inverse probability of censoring weighting ( IPCW ) are used to account for selective crossover to letrozole of patients ( n=619 ) in the tamoxifen arm . Comparison of sequential treatments to letrozole monotherapy included patients enrolled and randomly assigned to letrozole for 5 years, letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years, or tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years. Treatment has ended for all patients and detailed safety results for adverse events that occurred during the 5 years of treatment have been reported elsewhere. Follow-up is continuing for those enrolled in the four-arm option. BIG 1-98 is registered at clinicaltrials.govNCT00004205. ### findings 8010 patients were included in the trial, with a median follow-up of 8·1 years (range 0-12·4). 2459 were randomly assigned to monotherapy with tamoxifen for 5 years and 2463 to monotherapy with letrozole for 5 years. In the four-arm option of the trial, 1546 were randomly assigned to letrozole for 5 years, 1548 to tamoxifen for 5 years, 1540 to letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years, and 1548 to tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years. At a median follow-up of 8·7 years from randomisation (range 0-12·4), letrozole monotherapy was significantly better than tamoxifen, whether by IPCW or intention-to-treat analysis (IPCW disease-free survival HR 0·82 [95% CI 0·74-0·92], overall survival HR 0·79 [0·69-0·90], DRFI HR 0·79 [0·68-0·92], BCFI HR 0·80 [0·70-0·92]; intention-to-treat disease-free survival HR 0·86 [0·78-0·96], overall survival HR 0·87 [0·77-0·999], DRFI HR 0·86 [0·74-0·998], BCFI HR 0·86 [0·76-0·98]). At a median follow-up of 8·0 years from randomisation (range 0-11·2) for the comparison of the sequential groups with letrozole monotherapy, there were no statistically significant differences in any of the four endpoints for either sequence. 8-year intention-to-treat estimates (each with SE ≤1·1%) for letrozole monotherapy, letrozole followed by tamoxifen, and tamoxifen followed by letrozole were 78·6%, 77·8%, 77·3% for disease-free survival; 87·5%, 87·7%, 85·9% for overall survival; 89·9%, 88·7%, 88·1% for DRFI; and 86·1%, 85·3%, 84·3% for BCFI. ### interpretation For postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer, a reduction in breast cancer recurrence and mortality is obtained by letrozole monotherapy when compared with tamoxifen montherapy. Sequential treatments involving tamoxifen and letrozole do not improve outcome compared with letrozole monotherapy, but might be useful strategies when considering an individual patient's risk of recurrence and treatment tolerability. ### funding Novartis, United States National Cancer Institute, International Breast Cancer Study Group.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22018631/", "doc_id": "72830b924efe02f8d02dbfad93ee887d"}

We therefore compared the long-term effects of exemestane monotherapy with sequential treatment (tamoxifen followed by exemestane). ### methods The Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational ( TEAM ) phase 3 trial was conducted in hospitals in nine countries . Postmenopausal women (median age 64 years, range 35-96) with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to open-label exemestane (25 mg once a day, orally) alone or following tamoxifen (20 mg once a day, orally) for 5 years. Randomisation was by use of a computer-generated random permuted block method. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years. Main analyses were by intention to treat.

The third-generation aromatase inhibitors ( AIs ) , including anastrozole , exemestane and letrozole , have demonstrated improved efficacy versus tamoxifen for the adjuvant endocrine treatment of postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer . AIs can be used in several adjuvant endocrine settings: as upfront therapy, switch to an AI after 2-3years of tamoxifen or extended therapy following 5years of tamoxifen. In the switch setting, two different types of study designs have been utilized. One is a late randomization design which randomizes patients who are disease-free after 2-3years of tamoxifen to receive an AI versus continuation of tamoxifen. In contrast, an early randomization design randomizes all patients immediately after primary treatment and prior to starting tamoxifen. Efficacy benefits with AIs have been shown in several trials evaluating the late randomization strategy, including the Intergroup exemestane Study, the Italian tamoxifen anastrozole trial and the anastrozole-Nolvadex 95 trial. Similarly, early randomization studies, including the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group-8 and the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial, have demonstrated the effectiveness of receiving an AI after tamoxifen. Two trials are assessing an early switch strategy versus upfront AI therapy: the BIG 1-98 trial and the ongoing tamoxifen exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre trial are assessing switching from tamoxifen to an AI after 2-3years versus upfront AI therapy.

A density functional study. To examine how azole inhibitors interact with the heme active site of the cytochrome P450 enzymes, we have performed a series of density functional theory studies on azole binding. These are the first density functional studies on azole interactions with a heme center and give fundamental insight into how azoles inhibit the catalytic function of P450 enzymes. Since azoles come in many varieties, we tested three typical azole motifs representing a broad range of azole and azole-type inhibitors: methylimidazolate, methyltriazolate, and pyridine. These structural motifs represent typical azoles , such as econazole , fluconazole , and metyrapone . The calculations show that azole binding is a stepwise mechanism whereby first the water molecule from the resting state of P450 is released from the sixth binding site of the heme to create a pentacoordinated active site followed by coordination of the azole nitrogen to the heme iron. This process leads to the breaking of a hydrogen bond between the resting state water molecule and the approaching inhibitor molecule. Although, formally, the water molecule is released in the first step of the reaction mechanism and a pentacoordinated heme is created, this does not lead to an observed spin state crossing. Thus, we show that release of a water molecule from the resting state of P450 enzymes to create a pentacoordinated heme will lead to a doublet to quartet spin state crossing at an Fe-OH(2) distance of approximately 3.0 A, while the azole substitution process takes place at shorter distances. Azoles bind heme with significantly stronger binding energies than a water molecule, so that these inhibitors block the catalytic cycle of the enzyme and prevent oxygen binding and the catalysis of substrate oxidation. Perturbations within the active site (e.g., a polarized environment) have little effect on the relative energies of azole binding. Studies with an extra hydrogen-bonded ethanol molecule in the model, mimicking the active site of the CYP121 P450, show that the resting state and azole binding structures are close in energy, which may lead to chemical equilibrium between the two structures, as indeed observed with recent protein structural studies that have demonstrated two distinct azole binding mechanisms to P450 heme.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18563875/", "doc_id": "4b95bba024fb2e67f272f90f02ed77c0"}

A recently developed taxane-cabazitaxel-has poor affinity for P-gp and is thereby effective in docetaxel-resistant CRPC. It has been recently demonstrated that exosomes in the body fluids could serve as a diagnostic marker because they contain proteins and RNAs specific to the cells from which they are derived. In this study, we aimed to investigate if P-gp in blood exosomes could be a marker to diagnose docetaxel resistance and select a taxoid for patients with CRPC. ### Methods And Materials Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer (PC-3) cells (PC-3R) and their parental PC-3 cells and from the serum of patients. Silencing of P-gp was performed by small interfering RNA transfection. Protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis. Viability of cells treated with docetaxel or cabazitaxel was determined by water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assay. ### results The level of P-gp was higher in exosomes as well as cell lysates from PC-3R cells than in those from PC-3 cells. Cabazitaxel effectively killed PC-3R cells , and MDR1 knockdown improved the sensitivity of PC-3R cells to docetaxel but not to cabazitaxel . The P-gp level in blood exosomes was relatively higher in clinically docetaxel-resistant patients than in therapy-naïve patients. ### conclusions Our results suggest that detection of P-gp in blood exosomes, which is involved in resistance to docetaxel but not to cabazitaxel, could be useful to diagnose docetaxel resistance and select an appropriate taxoid for patients with CRPC-docetaxel or cabazitaxel.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26027763/", "doc_id": "0713ecdff351b72f27677723d0a8cc65"}

The NIBIT-MESO-1 study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tremelimumab combined with durvalumab in patient with unresectable mesothelioma followed up for a median of 52 months [ IQR 49 - 53 ] . Here, we report 4-year survival and outcomes after retreatment, and the role of tumour mutational burden (TMB) in identifying patients who might have a better outcome in response to combined therapy. ### methods NIBIT-MESO-1 was an open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial of patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma who received intravenous tremelimumab (1 mg/kg bodyweight) and durvalumab (20 mg/kg bodyweight) every 4 weeks for four doses, followed by maintenance intravenous durvalumab at the same dose and schedule for nine doses. In this follow-up study, patients with disease progression following initial clinical benefit-ie, a partial repsonse or stable disease-were eligible for retreatment and with the same doses and schedules for tremelimumab and durvalumab as used in the NIBIT-MESO-1 trial. The primary endpoint, immune-related objective response rate, was evaluated per immune-related modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or immune-related RECIST 1.1 criteria for patients with pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma, respectively. Key secondary endpoints were overall survival and safety, and TMB was also evaluated post hoc in patients who had tumour tissue available before treatment. The intention-to-treat population was used for analysis of all efficacy endpoints. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02588131. ### findings 40 patients were enrolled in the NIBIT-MESO-1 study between Oct 30, 2015, and Oct 12, 2016. At data cut-off, April 30, 2020, five (13%) of 40 patients were alive, and 35 (88%) patients had died of progressive disease. At a median follow-up of 52 months (IQR 49-53), median overall survival was 16·5 months (95% CI 13·7-19·2). Survival was 20% (eight of 40 patients) at 36 months and 15% (six of 40 patients) and 48 months. 17 (43%) of 40 patients met the criteria for enrolment in the retreatment study and were retreated with at least one dose of tremelimumab and durvalumab. No immune-related objective responses were observed in the 17 retreated patients. Seven (41%) of 17 patients achieved immune-related stable disease. From the start of retreatment to a median follow-up of 24 months (22·0-25·0), median overall survival was 12·5 months (95% CI 0·0-25·8), and survival at 12 months was 52·9%, at 18 months was 35·3%, and at 24 months was 23·5%. There were no grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events in the retreatment cohort. In a post-hoc analysis of 28 patients for whom tumour tissue before treatment was available, patients with a TMB higher than the median value of 8·3 mutations per Mb had a higher median overall survival compared with patients with TMB below the median value, but this difference was non-significant. Moreover, when patients were additionally stratified for ICI retreatment (n=13), there was a significant difference in survival between those with a TMB higher than the median of 8·3 mutations per Mb and those with TMB lower than the median in the retreated cohort (41·3 months vs 17·4 months; p=0·02). ### interpretation tremelimumab combined with durvalumab was associated with long-term survival in patients with mesothelioma.

Secondary end points were overall survival, occurrence of adverse events, tolerability, and status of lymph node dissection. ### results Among 788 eligible patients , the median ( SD ) age was 59 ( 22 - 74 ) years ; 263 patients were assigned to doxorubicin plus cisplatin treatment , 263 patients to docetaxel plus cisplatin treatment , and 262 patients to paclitaxel plus carboplatin treatment .

Tolerability of these regimens were not statistically different. After a median follow-up period of 7 years, there was no statistical difference of progression-free survival (doxorubicin plus cisplatin, 191; docetaxel plus cisplatin, 208; paclitaxel plus carboplatin, 187; P = .12) or overall survival (doxorubicin plus cisplatin, 217; docetaxel plus cisplatin, 223; paclitaxel plus carboplatin, 215; P = .67) among the 3 groups.

Because each regimen showed adequate tolerability but different toxic effects, taxane plus platinum regimens may be a reasonable alternative to treatment with doxorubicin plus cisplatin. ### Trial Registration UMIN-CTR identifier: UMIN000000522.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30896757/", "doc_id": "975865298fd67bd4b6ff56a8d8929f5f"}

We hypothesized that this form of lymphocytosis was in part due to shedding of cell adhesion molecules from the cell surface and a subsequent detachment of lymphocytes adhering to the vascular endothelium in lymphocyte reservoirs. In this study, healthy human volunteers (n = 12) were exercised on a treadmill until exhaustion. The circulating levels of the soluble cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and E-Selectin were determined by ELISA. The subjects were then randomly assigned to treatment with either propranolol or metoprolol and repeated the exercise protocol after 1 week of treatment . Prior to drug treatment, soluble ICAM-1 levels rose from 258 +/- 19 to 321 +/- 28 ng/ml following exercise and returned to approximate baseline levels of 263 +/- 22 ng/ml after 1 h of rest. This highly significant effect of exercise on circulating ICAM-1 levels (p < .005) was mitigated after treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonists. Soluble E-Selectin levels were not significantly affected by exercise. These results suggest that dynamic exercise leads to shedding of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 via adrenergic mechanisms. We believe that these findings will contribute to the understanding of how physical and mental stress modulate lymphocyte migration and adhesion.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9512820/", "doc_id": "5e1b7e15286c15dfdac6bb72c128fdf7"}

Selective inhibitors of 11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type I may be of therapeutical interest for two reasons: i) 9alpha-Fluorinated 11-dehydrosteroids like 11-dehydro-dexamethasone (DH-D) are rapidly activated by human kidney 11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type II (11beta-HSD-II) to dexamethasone (D). If the same reaction by hepatic 11beta-HSD-I could be selectively inhibited, DH-D could be used for selective renal immunosuppressive therapy. ii) Reduction of cortisone to cortisol in the liver may increase insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and inhibition of the enzyme may lead to a decrease in gluconeogenesis. Therefore, we characterized the metabolism of DH-D by human hepatic 11beta-HSD-I and tried to find a selective inhibitor of this isoenzyme. ### methods For kinetic analysis of 11beta-HSD-I, we used microsomes prepared from unaffected parts of liver segments, resected because of hepatocarcinoma or metastatic disease. For inhibition experiments, we also tested 11beta-HSD-II activity with human kidney cortex microsomes. The inhibitory potency of several compounds was evaluated for oxidation and reduction in concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-5)mol/l. ### results Whereas D was not oxidized by human liver microsomes at all, cortisol was oxidized to cortisone with a maximum velocity (V(max)) of 95pmol/mg per min. The reduction of DH-D to D (V(max)=742pmol/mg per min, Michaelis--Menten constant (K(m))=1.6 micromol/l) was faster than that of cortisone to cortisol (V(max)=187pmol/mg per min). All reactions tested in liver microsomes showed the characteristics of 11beta-HSD-I: K(m) values in the micromolar range, preferred cosubstrate NADP(H), no product inhibition. Of the substances tested for inhibition of 11beta-HSD-I and -II , chenodeoxycholic acid was the only one that selectively inhibited 11beta-HSD-I ( IC(50 ) for reduction : 2.8x10(-6)mol/l , IC(50 ) for oxidation : 4.4x10(-6)mol/l ) , whereas ketoconazole preferentially inhibited oxidation and reduction reactions catalyzed by 11beta-HSD-II . metyrapone, which is reduced to metyrapol by hepatic 11beta-HSD-I, inhibited steroid reductase activity of 11beta-HSD-I and -II and oxidative activity of 11beta-HSD-II. These findings can be explained by substrate competition for reductase reactions and by product inhibition of the oxidation, which is a well-known characteristic of 11beta-HSD-II. ### conclusions Our in vitro results may offer a new concept for renal glucocorticoid targeting. Oral administration of small amounts of DH-D (low substrate affinity for 11beta-HSD-I) in combination with chenodeoxycholic acid (selective inhibition of 11beta-HSD-I) may prevent hepatic first pass reduction of DH-D, thus allowing selective activation of DH-D to D by the high affinity 11beta-HSD-II in the kidney. Moreover, selective inhibitors of the hepatic 11beta-HSD-I, like chenodeoxycholic acid, may become useful in the therapy of patients with hepatic insulin resistance including diabetes mellitus type II, because cortisol enhances gluconeogenesis.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10664531/", "doc_id": "54ea32b020e5101565fb894aa10d6e16"}

Eligible patients were 40 years of age or older with a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years and a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with severe airflow limitation, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, and at least two exacerbations in the previous year.

Hierarchical linear modelling was used to analyse these longitudinal data. ### results The overall pattern of weight change was a cubic form beginning with a mean of 56·9 kg before chemotherapy. It gradually increased to 59·4 kg at 8·5 months after the first chemotherapy followed by a decrease to 58·5 kg at 21·5 months.

Mutations in the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase gene (KIT), which result in constitutive activation of the protein (KIT), are causally related to the development of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). imatinib, a targeted anticancer drug, exerts a therapeutic effect against GISTs by repressing the kinase activity of KIT. Long-term administration of this drug, however, causes the emergence of imatinib-resistant GISTs. We performed quantitative phosphoproteome analysis using a cell-based GIST model system comprising an imatinib-sensitive GIST cell line (GIST882), GIST882 under treatment with imatinib (GIST882-IM), and secondary imatinib-resistant GIST882 (GIST882-R). Phosphorylated peptides were purified from each cell line using titania-based affinity chromatography or anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation, and then subjected to LC-MS/MS based quantitative phosphoproteome analysis. Using this method we identified augmentation of the kinase activities of multiple elements of the signal transduction pathway, especially KIT and EGFR. Although, these elements were up-regulated in GIST882-R, no additionally mutated KIT mRNA was found in secondary imatinib-resistant GIST cells. Treatment of GIST882-R with imatinib in combination with gefitinib , an EGFR inhibitor , partially prevented cell growth , implying that EGFR may be involved in acquisition of secondary imatinib resistance in GIST . ### Biological Significance In this study, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteome analysis using a cell culture-based GIST model system. The goal of the study was to investigate the mechanism of acquired resistance in GISTs against imatinib, a molecularly targeted drug that inhibits kinase activity of the KIT protein and that has been approved for the treatment of GISTs. In imatinib-resistant GIST cells, we observed elevated expression of KIT and restoration of its kinase activity, as well as activation of multiple proliferative signaling pathways. Our results indicate that the effects of even so-called 'molecularly targeted' drugs, are broad rather than convergent, and that the mechanisms of action of such drugs during continuous administration are extremely complex.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25554490/", "doc_id": "f67b8b02b47a8036885907fa7d3afd2b"}

Inflammation is characteristic of a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases.

Morphologically, the level of inflammation is determined by the concentration and degree of activation of microglial cells. Biochemically, it is judged by the presence of a spectrum of inflammatory mediators. Epidemiological evidence indicates that anti-inflammatory agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a sparing effect on AD and PD indicating that inflammation exacerbates the pathology in these diseases. NSAIDs are protective in transgenic animal models of AD, providing further evidence of the negative consequences of inflammation. Here we describe an in vitro model, which was used to study the protective effects of NSAIDs in AD. This model is based on neuronal cell killing by stimulated microglia or microglia-like cells. In this model NSAIDs show protective effects at a therapeutically relevant level, which is in the low micromolar range.

As PPI metabolism also involves CYP2C19, it was hypothesized that competition by PPIs might interfere with clopidogrel's action. omeprazole, but not other PPIs, worsens surrogate markers of clopidogrel efficacy. Some (but not all) observational studies show that clopidogrel users prescribed PPIs have increased risks of CV events (hazard/odds ratios=1.25-1.5). When effect sizes are small to moderate (relative risks<1.5-2.0), however, it is only possible to conclude whether statistical associations are valid in randomized trials. A randomized trial of omeprazole vs. placebo in clopidogrel users showed no difference in CV events (hazard ratio=1.02,0.70-1.51). Thus, current evidence does not justify a conclusion that PPIs are associated with CV events among clopidogrel users, let alone a judgment of causality.

Group B : From January , 1976 to December , 1980 , 55 evaluable patients participated in a consecutive study that added Adriamycin ( doxorubicin ) and cyclophosphamide to the former induction regimen . Central nervous system (CNS) prevention was performed with 5 doses of intrathecal methotrexate-dexamethasone. Maintenance treatment was the same. Prognostic factors as stage and primary site were comparable in both groups. A total of 33 (66%) of 50 children of Group A and 48 (87%) of 55 children of Group B achieved complete remission (P less than 0.005). Disease-free survival at 60 months was 27% in Group A and 49% in Group B; for Stage I-II, 30% in Group A and 85% in Group B (P less than 0.025); for Stage III-IV 28% in Group A and 36% in Group B (not significant). In Group A, 9.1% and in Group B, 8.3% had primary CNS relapse. Both maintenance schedules had the same relapse rate. It was concluded that: (1) the addition of Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide to vincristine-prednisone in Group B produces a higher rate of complete remission in Stage III-IV, a higher rate of disease-free survival in Stage I-II, and a higher survival rate in all stages; (2) CNS prevention with intrathecal methotrexate-dexamethasone is equally effective as cranial radiation plus intrathecal methotrexate-dexamethasone; and (3) anti-leukemia and anti-lymphoma maintenance are equally effective in the context of this study.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6388820/", "doc_id": "960105c5f66a50001d208fdbe4f96ccb"}

The history of anti-obesity drug development is far from glorious, with transient magic bullets and only a handful of agents currently licensed for clinical use. In view of recent progress in our understanding of the multiplicity of signalling pathways involved in appetite regulation, and the resultant deluge of reports on the anorectic efficacy of novel therapies, it seems timely to stress the need to differentiate treatments that suppress intake by primary means from those that only indirectly achieve this endpoint. The current article reviews the conceptual history of the behavioural satiety sequence (BSS), also known as the behavioural sequence of satiety, post-ingestive satiety, and the postprandial satiety sequence. Early research confirmed that natural satiation, produced by a caloric load on the gut, is associated with a predictable transition from feeding through grooming to resting. Although many less naturalistic manipulations are also capable of reducing food intake, very few do so without disrupting the normal structure of this feeding cycle. Thus, while CCK and d-fenfluramine reduce intake by accelerating but otherwise maintaining the integrity of the BSS, other anorectic interventions disrupt the BSS through response competition (e.g. d-amphetamine), nausea/discomfort (e.g. lithium chloride) and/or interference with taste-mediated positive feedback (e.g. quinine adulteration of the diet). A substantial literature now strongly supports the specific involvement of serotonin 5-HT(1B ) and 5-HT(2C ) receptor subtypes in satiety and in the anorectic effect of agents such as fenfluramine and fluoxetine . Recent BSS analyses have also identified rather selective anorectic profiles for the dual noradrenaline and 5-HT reuptake inhibitor sibutramine, the orexin-1 receptor antagonist SB-334867, and the broad spectrum opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. However, similar analyses have offered little/no support for the anorectic potential of the gut peptide PYY(3-36) while the acute anorectic efficacy of cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonists appears largely to be secondary to response competition. In contrast, studies with low-dose combinations of naloxone and CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonists have very recently confirmed the potential of drug polytherapies not only in appetite suppression but also in attenuating/eliminating unwanted side-effects. In sum, as BSS analysis offers a reliable means of differentiating the wheat (primary anorectics) from the chaff (secondary anorectics), it should form an integral part of early phase testing in any anti-obesity drug screening programme.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20214921/", "doc_id": "fa9ceb85fec23bbd0522dd1f81e97f53"}

In the presence of an epithelial Na(+) channel blocker, amiloride, neither carbachol nor pilocarpine affected the Na(+) level of secreted saliva; however, it significantly increased the Na(+) content of cevimeline-induced saliva.

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is characterized by excellent response to treatment, if diagnosed correctly. Lifestyle advice is an integral part of the treatment of JME; it should include recommendations on avoidance of common triggers such as sleep deprivation and alcohol excess and emphasis on the importance of compliance with medication. The drug of first choice in the treatment of JME is sodium valproate, which has a response rate of up to 80%. Valproate should be avoided in women of childbearing age because of significantly increased risks of fetal malformations and neurodevelopmental delay. levetiracetam or lamotrigine are alternative first-line options if valproate is contraindicated. With limited data from trials to support either of these drugs, the choice should take into account comorbidity factors and patient priorities. Because of its low side effect profile, excellent tolerability, and lack of interactions with other drugs, levetiracetam is our preferred alternative first-line agent. lamotrigine is another first-line option but may exacerbate myoclonus. The failure of valproate or failure of two first-line antiepileptic drugs suggests that combination therapy is indicated.

In women of childbearing potential , valproate should be considered if levetiracetam and lamotrigine have failed to control seizures at this stage . topiramate is a cost-effective alternative monotherapy, but because of its poor tolerability, we recommend it as add-on treatment only. zonisamide should remain a second-line adjunct in the treatment of JME, owing to the lack of supportive data. Phenobarbital is the most cost-effective drug and can be used to control the seizures of JME when antiepileptic drugs are limited or too costly. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin can exacerbate absences and myoclonus and are therefore contraindicated, although they can improve control of tonic-clonic seizures when these are refractory to other medication. gabapentin, pregabalin, tiagabine, and vigabatrin are contraindicated and can worsen seizures. (tiagabine and vigabatrin have been reported to induce absence status epilepticus.) Surgical alternatives in refractory cases are rarely contemplated but may include vagus nerve stimulation and callosotomy. Deep brain stimulation is an experimental technique that may prove useful in managing refractory cases of JME.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21494841/", "doc_id": "8caeec4c972d1568c6153dc1fac3df09"}

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) of multi-factorial etiopathogenesis is rising worldwide. Treatment-associated toxicity problems and treatment failure in advanced disease stages with conventional therapies have necessitated a focus on alternative strategies. Molecular targeted therapy, with the potential for increased selectivity and fewer adverse effects, hold promise in the treatment of HNSCC. In an attempt to improve outcomes in HNSCC, targeted therapeutic strategies have been developed. These strategies are focusing on the molecular biology of HNSCC in an attempt to target selected pathways involved in carcinogenesis. Inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis by focusing on specific protein or signal transduction pathways or by targeting the tumor microenvironment or vasculature are some of the new approaches.

However, the rosiglitazone users (alone or combined with metformin) showed a more notable decline in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. ### Conclusion S Considering the benefits of metformin on weight loss, high-dose metformin (1,500 mg/day) along with lifestyle modification should be recommended for obese, insulin-resistant women with PCOS. rosiglitazone alone or combined with low-dosage metformin plus lifestyle modification should be considered for the women with abnormal lipid profiles. ### Clinical Trial Registration Number ChiCTR-TRC-13003642 (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry).", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31718828/", "doc_id": "bcf8beb68f7f3a805ddcdc34243375e9"}

CAH is an uncommon disorder that results from a defect in steroid hormones biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex. The clinical presentation depends on the site of enzymatic mutations and the types of accumulated steroid precursors. A 22-year-old woman who was diagnosed to have hypertension since the age of 10 years who was treated with anti-hypertensive therapy was referred to the National Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, Royal Hospital, Oman. The patient also had primary amenorrhea and features of sexual infantilism. Full laboratory and radio-imaging investigations were done. Adrenal steroids, pituitary function and karyotyping study were performed and the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular mutation study. Laboratory investigations revealed adrenal steroids and pituitary hormones profile in addition to 46XY karyotype that are consistent with the diagnosis of CAH due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency. Extensive laboratory workup revealed low levels of serum cortisol (and its precursors 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-deoxycortisol), adrenal androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstenedione), and estrogen (estradiol); and high levels of mineralocorticoids precursors (11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone) with high levels of ACTH, FSH and LH.

Although there are now a number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) available, approximately one-third of epilepsy patients respond poorly to drug intervention. The reasons for this are complex, but are probably reflective of the increasing number of identified mutations that predispose individuals to this disease. Thus, there is a clear requirement for the development of novel treatments to address this unmet clinical need. The existence of gene mutations that mimic a seizure-like behaviour in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, offers the possibility to exploit the powerful genetics of this insect to identify novel cellular targets to facilitate design of more effective AEDs. In this study we use neuronal expression of GCaMP, a potent calcium reporter, to image neuronal activity using a non-invasive and rapid method. Expression in motoneurons in the isolated CNS of third instar larvae shows waves of calcium-activity that pass between segments of the ventral nerve cord. Time between calcium peaks, in the same neurons, between adjacent segments usually show a temporal separation of greater than 200 ms. Exposure to proconvulsants (picrotoxin or 4-aminopyridine) reduces separation to below 200 ms showing increased synchrony of activity across adjacent segments. Increased synchrony, characteristic of epilepsy, is similarly observed in genetic seizure mutants: bangsenseless1 (bss1) and paralyticK1270T (paraK1270T). Exposure of bss1 to clinically-used antiepileptic drugs ( phenytoin or gabapentin ) significantly reduces synchrony . In this study we use the measure of synchronicity to evaluate the effectiveness of known and novel anticonvulsive compounds (antipain, isethionate, etopiside rapamycin and dipyramidole) to reduce seizure-like CNS activity. We further show that such compounds also reduce the Drosophila voltage-gated persistent Na+ current (INaP) in an identified motoneuron (aCC).

Forty patients (48%) obtained a complete hematologic and clinical remission. A history of an antecedent hematologic disorder, male sex, and absence of Auer rods were adverse factors for achieving remission in this older population. More than half of the patients achieved remission in one course. The major cause of failure to obtain a remission was death due to infection, 40% of which were caused by fungi.

The promising clinical activity of paclitaxel has also promoted considerable interest in combining this drug with other anti-tumor agents. In this study, we assessed the cytotoxic interaction between paclitaxel and gemcitabine administered at various schedules to human breast and ovarian cancer cells. Through a series of in vitro assays including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, DNA fragmentation, and flow cytometric analyses, we found that gemcitabine could significantly antagonize the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel when tumor cells were exposed to the two drugs simultaneously or exposed to gemcitabine before paclitaxel.

Emphasis was placed on original studies published since 1975. ### Data Extraction Data from published research were extracted and evaluated according to study design, sample size, dosing regimen, outcome measures, and treatment efficacy and safety. ### Data Synthesis Infantile spasms constitute a rare epileptic syndrome with a poor long-term prognosis for normal intellectual development. The spasms are characterized by a brief symmetric contraction of the muscles of the neck, trunk, and/or extremities, often occurring in a series of 2 to more than 100 spasms during a single episode. The disorder is age-specific, with the peak onset of symptoms occurring between 2 and 8 months of age. Spasms of no identifiable cause in infants with normal development prior to the onset of infantile spasms are classified as cryptogenic or idiopathic, whereas those with an identifiable cause are classified as symptomatic. Long-term prognosis is best in cryptogenic cases, with 30-70 percent attaining normal intellect compared with 5-19 percent in symptomatic cases. The etiology and pathophysiology are not well understood. Recent theory postulates that infantile spasms may be caused by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone activity during infancy. The suspected association between the whole-cell pertussis vaccine and infantile spasms is coincidental. Few well-designed, prospective, controlled clinical trials for the treatment of infantile spasms have been conducted. ### conclusions Standard anticonvulsants such as phenytoin , the barbiturates , carbamazepine , and the succinimides have been ineffective . Of the anticonvulsants, only the benzodiazepines, valproic acid, and vigabatrin have shown efficacy in reducing spasm frequency and severity. Hormonal therapy with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and/or prednisone has been the most frequently studied treatment modality and appears to be the most effective. Hormonal therapy achieves complete spasm control in 50-75 percent of infants within four weeks of initiation. Opinions differ regarding the relative efficacy between ACTH and prednisone, the need for early initiation of hormonal treatment, and the benefits of high dosages of ACTH (> 40 units/d). No treatment has been shown conclusively to improve the long-term intellectual development of these infants. Neurosurgery may be the treatment of choice in select cases when a localized central nervous system abnormality can be demonstrated. Well-designed, blind, prospective clinical trials are needed to answer definitively many lingering questions regarding the treatment of infantile spasms.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7919570/", "doc_id": "d4af3bd7f0037132c5d1b2c3bd96e0c4"}

The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of Aurora A mediated doxorubicin insensitivity in MCF-7Dox/R, an isolated resistant-subline of MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma cell line). Effect of curcumin, a natural phytochemical in restoring doxorubicin sensitivity by targeting Aurora A was assessed furthermore. ### methods A doxorubicin resistant subline (MCF-7Dox/R) was isolated from the parental MCF-7 cells by treating the cell with gradual step-wise increasing concentration of the drug. Expressions of Aurora A and its target proteins (Akt, IκBα and NFκB) were assessed in both parental and MCF-7Dox/R cells.

Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) require surgical intervention and empiric antibacterial therapy. doripenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem, provides coverage of key gram-negative and -positive aerobes and anaerobes encountered in cIAI. ### objective This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety profile of doripenem and meropenem in hospitalized adult patients with cIAI. ### methods In this prospective, multicenter, doubleblind, noninferiority study, hospitalized adults with cIAI were randomly assigned to receive doripenem 500 mg IV q8h or meropenem 1 g IV q8h. After a minimum of 9 doses and adequate clinical improvement (relative to before the start of IV study drug, decreased body temperature and white blood cell count, improved or absent signs and symptoms of cIAI, and return of normal bowel function), patients could be switched to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate. Antibacterial therapy (IV plus subsequent oral) was given for a total of 5 to 14 days. The coprimary efficacy end points were the clinical cure rate (complete resolution or significant improvement of signs or symptoms of the index infection) in patients microbiologically evaluable (>or=1 baseline pathogen isolated from an intra-abdominal culture that was susceptible to both IV study drug therapies) at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (21-60 days after the completion of study drug therapy) and the clinical cure rate in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population (a bacterial pathogen identified at baseline, regardless of its susceptibility to the study drug). Noninferiority was concluded if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95 % CI for the difference ( doripenem minus meropenem ) in the proportion of patients classified as clinical cures was > or=-15 % . ### results A total of 476 patients were enrolled. The microbiologically evaluable population (319 patients) was 62.7% male and 67.7% white, with a mean age and weight of 46.7 years and 77.2 kg, respectively. In this population, doripenem and meropenem were associated with clinical cure rates at the TOC visit of 85.9% and 85.3%, respectively. The corresponding treatment difference was 0.6% (95% CI, -7.7% to 9.0%); this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, in the mMITT population (385 patients), the clinical cure rates were 77.9% and 78.9%, respectively, and the corresponding 1.0% treatment difference was not statistically significant (95% CI, -9.7% to 7.7%). Clinical cure rates were not significantly different between the 2 treatment arms in key subgroups (eg, age, sex, race, baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, primary infection site). Microbiological eradication rates for common pathogens isolated at study entry were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups. doripenem was well tolerated in the population studied. In the intent-to-treat population (471 patients), 83.0% and 78.0% of patients experienced >or=1 adverse event (AE) and 13.2% and 14.0% experienced >or=1 serious AE in the doripenem and meropenem treatment arms, respectively. In the doripenem and meropenem treatment arms, AEs resulted in study drug discontinuation in 5.1% and 2.1% of patients and death in 2.1% and 3.0% of patients, respectively. ### conclusions The present study found that doripenem (500 mg q8h) was effective in the treatment of cIAI, was therapeutically noninferior to meropenem (1 g q8h), with a safety profile not significantly different from that of meropenem in this selected population of patients with cIAI.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18555934/", "doc_id": "ad06d06e0a0caf1864998ab4d0c1f297"}

The clinical benefit afforded by these treatments can be accompanied by a unique spectrum of adverse events, called immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which reflect the drug's immune-based mechanism of action. IrAEs typically originate in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and endocrine system, although other organ systems may also be affected. This article provides an overview of irAEs associated with anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) as monotherapy or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibition (ipilimumab), followed by a discussion of irAEs of special clinical interest based on the potential for morbidity, frequent steroid use, and inpatient admission. We review clinical trial data and provide recommendations on how to manage irAEs associated with anti-PD-1 agents based on clinical experience and established management guidelines. We further illustrate the practical considerations of managing irAEs by presenting three cases of immune-related toxicity in melanoma patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab . A better understanding of the identification and management of irAEs will help inform health care providers about the risks associated with anti-PD-1 treatment, to ensure the safe and appropriate use of these important new treatments. ### Implications For Practice Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefit in advanced melanoma and other tumor types. These treatments are associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which most commonly affect the skin and gastrointestinal tract, and, to a lesser extent, the liver, endocrine system, and other organs.

This study's objective was to determine the prevalence of body shape changes and metabolic abnormalities in an ambulant population with HIV infection. Three different definitions of lipodystrophy were used to assess these changes. Patients' anthropometric measures and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were compared in order to estimate fat distribution in this population. We sought to evaluate potential predictors for lipodystrophy according to each of the three definitions. ### methods We performed a cross-sectional study in the outpatient clinic of a tertiary referral hospital in Melbourne, Australia. We enrolled a total of 167 HIV-infected ambulatory patients over 3 months in mid-1998. Data on 159 males, 149 of whom were receiving triple combination antiretroviral therapy, were evaluated. Anthropometric measures, clinical examination, self-report of body shape changes, biochemical measures and DEXA scan were used to assess lipodystrophy and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Patients described body shape changes in the face, trunk, arms and legs. Laboratory parameters measured included fasting triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), glucose, insulin, CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA. Current and past antiretroviral therapies were ascertained. ### results According to one proposed Australian national definition of lipodystrophy (LDNC), the prevalence of lipodystrophy in this population was 65%. This definition included an objective assessment with major and minor criteria. Patient-defined lipodystrophy (LDP), which involved a subjective assessment of thinning arms and legs and central adiposity, occurred in 19%. Patient-defined lipoatrophy (LAP), which involved a subjective assessment of thinning arms and legs without central adiposity, occurred in 21.3%. No change in body habitus was noted by 37% of the cohort. Hypercholesterolaemia was recorded in 44%, hypertriglyceridaemia in 52% and elevated insulin levels in 23%. Anthropometry was predictive of the per cent total body fat recorded by DEXA scan, but produced consistently lower values. In multivariate analysis , LDP and LAP were significantly associated with stavudine ( d4 T ) use , while LAP was also associated with zidovudine ( ZDV ) treatment . There were no treatment associations with LDNC. Protease inhibitor (PI) exposure was associated with metabolic changes but not patient perceived body shape changes, while d4T and ZDV exposure was associated with increased triglycerides and reduced peripheral fat stores. ### conclusions The prevalence of body shape changes in a single population varied depending on the definition applied. The LDNC definition overestimated body shape abnormalities in comparison with patient perception. LAP was associated with significantly lower fat stores measured by anthropometry and DEXA scan than those identified under the LDNC definition. In contrast to LDNC, LAP was associated with d4T exposure, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and ZDV duration of use, but not PI use. Until a consensus definition for lipodystrophy is developed, including agreement on objective measurement and thresholds for abnormality, careful description of the individual components of the syndrome is required to enable cohort comparisons so that predictors of the syndrome can be assessed more accurately and outcome studies made feasible.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11737398/", "doc_id": "b4f6178a851fbb8ac91841c9d9abd82d"}

Identification of CYP3A4 as the major isoform responsible for colchicine demethylation. colchicine disposition involves both active biliary and renal excretion of parent drug, and at least in mammals a substantial fraction undergoes hepatic demethylation prior to excretion. We investigated the biotransformation of [3H]colchicine in a panel of microsomal preparations obtained from sixteen human liver samples. The production rate of the main metabolites of colchicine's 3-demethylcolchicine (3DMC) and 2-demethylcolchicine (2DMC), was linear in relation to incubation time, cytochrome (P450) content, and substrate concentration. Following the incubation of colchicine (5 nM) with microsomes in the presence of an NADPH-generating system for 60 min, 9.8% and 5.5% of the substrate were metabolized to 3DMC and 2DMC, respectively. The formation rate of colchicine metabolites exhibited a marked variation between the different microsomal preparations. The formation rates of both colchicine metabolites were correlated significantly with nifedipine oxidase activity, a marker of CYP3A4 activity (r = 0.96, P < 0.001), but not with the metabolic markers of CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 activities.

Furthermore , our group has shown that the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin is effective in anthracycline-resistant ABC . ### Patients And Methods From January 1996 until March 1997, 66 women with ABC were treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) by three-hour infusion followed by carboplatin at an AUC of 6 mg x min/ml every three weeks. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range 28-75). A total of 39 patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy and 22 of them were treated with an anthracycline or mitoxantrone-containing regimen. ### results A total of 324 cycles (median: six) were administered, 273 (85%) of them at full dose. The median number of delivered cycles was six. The median delivered dose intensity (DI) of paclitaxel was 55.1 mg/m2/week (range 30.5-69.3) and the relative DI was 0.95 (range 0.5-1.2).

We assessed the efficacy and safety of further bevacizumab therapy in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer whose disease had progressed after treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. ### methods In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients who had HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after receiving 12 weeks or more of first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy from 118 centres in 12 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a central interactive voice response system using a block randomisation schedule (block size four) stratified by hormone receptor status, first-line progression-free survival, selected chemotherapy, and lactate dehydrogenase concentration, to receive second-line single-agent chemotherapy either alone or with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Second-line therapy was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. At progression, patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone received third-line chemotherapy without bevacizumab; those randomly assigned to bevacizumab continued bevacizumab with third-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival from randomisation to second-line progression or death in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is ongoing, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01250379. ### findings Between Feb 17, 2011, and April 3, 2013, 494 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (247 in each group). The median duration of follow-up at the time of this prespecified primary progression-free survival analysis was 15·9 months (IQR 9·1-21·7) in the chemotherapy-alone group and 16·1 months (10·6-22·7) in the combination group. Progression-free survival was significantly longer for those patients treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy than for those with chemotherapy alone (median: 6·3 months [95% CI 5·4-7·2] vs 4·2 months [3·9-4·7], respectively, stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·75 [95% CI 0·61-0·93], two-sided stratified log-rank p=0·0068). The most common grade 3 or more adverse events were hypertension (33 [13%] of 245 patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy vs 17 [7%] of 238 patients receiving chemotherapy alone), neutropenia (29 [12%] vs 20 [8%]), and hand-foot syndrome (27 [11%] vs 25 [11%]). Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 17 (7%) of 245 patients receiving combination therapy and one (<1%) of 238 patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Serious adverse events were reported in 61 (25%) of 245 patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus 44 (18%) of 238 patients receiving chemotherapy alone. ### interpretation These results suggest that continued VEGF inhibition with further bevacizumab is a valid treatment option for patients with locally recurrent or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer whose disease was stabilised or responded to first-line bevacizumab with chemotherapy. ### funding F Hoffmann-La Roche.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25273342/", "doc_id": "f1cc7e30edeaee003ffd3a3b25b34687"}

We compared the benefits of a single cycle of high-dose chemotherapy and the benefits of conventional chemotherapy in patients with high-risk breast cancer in a prospective, unblinded, randomized trial. ### methods Between February 23, 1995, and June 29, 1999, 605 patients with breast cancer who had four or more positive lymph nodes were randomly assigned to treatment (307 to high-dose therapy and 298 to conventional therapy). The conventional chemotherapy regimen was four cycles of doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) followed by eight cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide [600 mg/m2], methotrexate [50 mg/m2], and 5-fluorouracil [600 mg/m2]), all given intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The high-dose regimen was four cycles of doxorubicin (75 mg/m2), followed by a single cycle of intermediate-dose cyclophosphamide (4000 mg/m2) supported by filgrastim (300 microg/day) for up to 10 days followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide (6000 mg/m2) and thiotepa (800 mg/m2). Peripheral blood progenitor cells were harvested by leukapheresis after treatment with cyclophosphamide and filgrastim and then re-infused after the high-dose cycle . Log-rank tests were used to compare survival rates. All statistical analyses were two-sided. ### results At a median follow-up of 6 years, no statistically significant differences were detected between the arms in 5-year relapse-free survival (high-dose arm = 57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 51% to 63%; conventional-dose arm = 54%, 95% CI = 48% to 61% (P =.73) or in 5-year overall survival (high-dose arm = 62%, 95% CI = 56% to 68%; conventional-dose arm = 64%, 95% CI = 57% to 70%) (P =.38). ### conclusion Autograft-supported, high-dose therapy is not superior to conventional chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer who have multiple involved lymph nodes.

The combination of paclitaxel and doxorubicin yielded response rates between 63% and 93% in phase I/II studies. In these studies, however, the investigators reported severe cardiac toxic events. The rationale for the current study was therefore to evaluate the combination of paclitaxel/epirubicin, focusing mainly on cardiac toxicity. In two groups, 85 patients with metastatic breast cancer entered the study. Approximately 20% of the patients had primary metastatic breast cancer with large tumors at the primary site. Half of the patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy. Study medication in group A consisted of epirubicin 60 mg/m2 given intravenously over 1 hour, followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion after premedication with steroids, antihistamines, and H2-blockers. In group B , epirubicin 90 mg/m2 was combined with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 , given in the same manner as in group A. Dose escalation to 225 mg/m2 paclitaxel was planned in both groups. The main toxicity in both groups was neutropenia (73% World Health Organization grade 3/4 in group A and 93% in group B). Other hematologic side effects were rare. No febrile neutropenia was reported in group A, but two episodes occurred in group B. Peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia, and myalgia were mild (only World Health Organization grades 1 and 2). Alopecia was universal. In group A, the paclitaxel dose could be escalated to 200 mg/m2 in 15 patients and to 225 mg/m2 in seven patients. Dose reduction due to severe neutropenia was necessary in 11 patients. No cardiac events were reported in group A. In group B, the paclitaxel dose could be escalated to 200 mg/m2 in only one patient, and no patient reached 225 mg/m2. Three patients needed a dose reduction. In this group, one patient had a greater than 10% decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction with no clinical signs. In group A, 43 patients were evaluable for response; in group B, 25 patients were evaluable. Thirteen patients were out of protocol with only bone metastasis, and two patients had more than one prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The response rate was identical in both groups, with five complete remissions and 24 partial remissions in group A and three complete responses and 14 partial remissions in group B. The duration of response was 8.2 months in both groups. The median cumulative epirubicin dose was 420 mg/m2 in group A and 630 mg/m2 in group B. The combination of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and epirubicin 60 or 90 mg/m2 can be administered safely to patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Several human cancers express SSTRs, including prostate cancer, and therefore SMS is of interest for anti-cancer therapy. DNA methylation and histone modifications are involved in normal cell development, gene imprinting and human carcinogenesis. Reversing DNA methylation is an attractive therapeutic possibility, since epigenetic modifications change gene expression without changing the gene function. DNA methylation inhibitors such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5'-aza, decitabine) have been used to treat several types of haematological malignancies. Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin (TSA), are a new class of 'targeted anti-cancer agents'. TSA and decitabine can induce growth arrest, apoptosis or terminal differentiation in a variety of solid and haematological cancers in advanced disease patients. In the present study, the LNCaP cell line (prostate cancer) was incubated with SMS or Somadex (an SMS polymer conjugate) for three days, 1 nM per day, and the untreated cells were the negative control. For DNA demethylation, cells were grown in the presence of 2.5 microM 5-aza for 120 h, and re-fed with 5-aza-containing fresh medium at day 3. The total incubation time with 5-aza was 120 h. TSA at 1.0 microM was added into the cultured cells for 24 h. The combined treatment of 5-aza and TSA was performed by incubating the cells with 5-aza for 120 h followed by a 24-h exposure to TSA. Using cDNA obtained from these cell lines, the difference in the expression level of SSTR mRNA transcripts before and after 5-aza and TSA treatments was analyzed by RT-PCR. An increased induction of mRNA expression of the five SSTR subtypes was observed in the LNCaP cells when incubated with SMS/Somadex (dose-dependent). The inhibition of DNA methylation and histone acetylation resulted in the up-regulation of SSTR5 mRNA expression. The results demonstrate a positive feedback loop between SMS and its receptors. This regulation pathway may enhance the anti-tumor activity of somatostatin. To benefit from this effect in a clinical setting, the dose, dose frequency and pan affinity of the SMS derivative are important factors. The epigenetic manipulation with DNA methylation or histone deacetylase inhibitors, combined with SMS, may offer a novel alternative for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18575731/", "doc_id": "789db177edc5cd5c6dfc1760f8ad5d0e"}

Background: To determine the relevance of drug interactions with co-medication for effectiveness and tolerability of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Method: A database (MALPRO2) on travelers on their flight home from Africa to Europe between July 1988 and December 1991 was reanalyzed. It contains data on prophylaxis with mefloquine ( n = 48,264 ) , with chloroquine ( 6,752 ) , with chloroquine plus proguanil ( 19,727 ) , and with no prophylaxis ( 3,871 ) . The comparison of rates of malaria incidence and adverse events (AEs) between users and nonusers of co-medication was expressed by relative risk (RR). Results: Fifty-three percent of travelers (63% of females, 43% of males) used co-medication in all prophylaxis groups, with an average of 1.35 additional drugs per person and about two AEs reported per person. With the exception of antidiarrheals plus mefloquine, malaria incidence with co-medication was lower (RR = 0.8) than without co-medication. In all regimens, the proportion of travelers reporting AEs was about 1.5-fold with co-medication (p<.01); that reporting severe AEs was twice as high as compared to with no co-medication. mefloquine AE rates for various classes of co-medication were similar to that of chloroquine, with highest AE and severity rates with neuropsychiatric drugs (excluding antiepileptics, RR = 1.9 and 2.9), and lowest rates with cardiovasculars (RR = 1.1 and 1.0). Various co-medications were used with different frequencies in males and females, and the latter reported more AEs. Conclusion: These data suggest that co-medications commonly used by travelers have no significant clinical impact on safety and effectiveness of prophylaxis with mefloquine or chloroquine.

We hypothesized that the brain damage mitigating effect of mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest can be enhanced with thiopental loading , and even more so with the further addition of phenytoin and methylprednisolone . Twenty-four dogs (four groups of six dogs each) received VF 12.5 min no-flow, reversed with brief cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), controlled ventilation to 20 h, and intensive care to 96 h. Group 1 with normothermia throughout and randomized group 2 with mild hypothermia (from reperfusion to 2 h) were controls. Then, group 3 received in addition, thiopental 90 mg/kg i.v. over the first 6 h. Then, group 4 received, in addition to group 2 treatment, thiopental 30 mg/kg i.v. over the first 90 min (because the larger dose had produced cardiopulmonary complications), plus phenytoin 15 mg/kg i.v. at 15 min after reperfusion, and methylprednisolone 130 mg/kg i.v. over 20 h. All dogs survived. Best overall performance categories (OPC) achieved (OPC 1 = normal, OPC 5 = brain death) were better in group 2 than group 1 (< 0.05) and numerically better in groups 3 or 4 than in groups 1 or 2. Good cerebral outcome (OPC 1 or 2) was achieved by all six dogs only in group 4 (P < 0.05 group 4 vs. 2).

Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable tumor due to the high rate of relapse that still occurs. Acquired drug resistance represents the most challenging obstacle to the extension of survival and several studies have been conducted to understand the mechanisms of this phenomenon. Mitochondrial pathways have been extensively investigated, demonstrating that cancer cells become resistant to drugs by reprogramming their metabolic assessment. MM cells acquire resistance to proteasome inhibitors (PIs), activating protection programs, such as a reduction in oxidative stress, down-regulating pro-apoptotic, and up-regulating anti-apoptotic signals. Knowledge of the mechanisms through which tumor cells escape control of the immune system and acquire resistance to drugs has led to the creation of new compounds that can restore the response by leading to cell death.

We performed multivariable modeling to control for baseline and on-treatment differences between groups. ### results Compared to subjects who received enzalutamide post-abiraterone, subjects who received docetaxel post-abiraterone had more bone metastases, more visceral metastases, higher baseline PSA, and had more frequent PSA tests while on-treatment. There were no significant differences in PSA30 (41% for enzalutamide vs. 53% for docetaxel) or PSA50 (34% vs. 40%) response rates between the two groups; there remained no difference after stratifying by presence/absence of prior response to abiraterone.

Systemic vasculitis is classified as primary (eg, polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome) or secondary, the latter associated with connective tissue disorders, infections, medications, and rarely, as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Neuropathy is a common complication of systemic vasculitis and is related to ischemic nerve fiber damage with axon loss. Peripheral neuropathy may be the sole manifestation of vasculitis, a condition termed nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN). Treatment of vasculitic neuropathy requires long-term immunosuppressive therapies with potential side effects. The diagnosis of vasculitis should be established by tissue (preferably nerve) biopsy. High-dose prednisone is the standard platform therapy for patients with systemic and NSVN; for those with systemic vasculitis, at least 3 to 12 months of treatment with cyclophosphamide (monthly intravenous pulse or daily oral therapy) is also necessary to sustain remission and allow successful prednisone tapering.

One resistance mechanism for cediranib is up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This study aimed to determine if dual therapy with cediranib and the oral EGFR inhibitor gefitinib improved outcome in recurrent glioblastoma. ### Methods And Findings This was a multi-center randomized , two-armed , double-blinded phase II study comparing cediranib plus gefitinib versus cediranib plus placebo in subjects with first relapse/first progression of glioblastoma following surgery and chemoradiotherapy . The primary outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and radiologic response rate. Recruitment was terminated early following suspension of the cediranib program. 38 subjects (112 planned) were enrolled with 19 subjects in each treatment arm. Median PFS with cediranib plus gefitinib was 3.6 months compared to 2.8 months for cediranib plus placebo (HR; 0.72, 90% CI; 0.41 to 1.26). Median OS was 7.2 months with cediranib plus gefitinib and 5.5 months with cediranib plus placebo (HR; 0.68, 90% CI; 0.39 to 1.19). Eight subjects (42%) had a partial response in the cediranib plus gefitinib arm versus five patients (26%) in the cediranib plus placebo arm. ### conclusions cediranib and gefitinib in combination is tolerated in patients with glioblastoma. Incomplete recruitment led to the study being underpowered. However, a trend towards improved survival and response rates with the addition of gefitinib to cediranib was observed. Further studies of the combination incorporating EGFR and VEGF inhibition are warranted. ### Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01310855.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27232884/", "doc_id": "5edd6b7bf1ec8e231328a5a83f5b82ae"}

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against EGFR and c-Met are initially effective when administered individually or in combination to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the overall efficacies of TKIs are limited due to the development of drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to elucidate mechanisms of EGFR and c-Met TKI resistance in order to develop more effective therapies. Model NSCLC cell lines H1975 and H2170 were used to study the similarities and differences in mechanisms of EGFR/c-Met TKI resistance. H1975 cells are positive for the T790M EGFR mutation, which confers resistance to current EGFR TKI therapies, while H2170 cells are EGFR wild-type. Previously, H2170 cells were made resistant to the EGFR TKI erlotinib and the c-Met TKI SU11274 by exposure to progressively increasing concentrations of TKIs. In H2170 and H1975 TKI-resistant cells, key Wnt and mTOR proteins were found to be differentially modulated. Wnt signaling transducer, active β-catenin was upregulated in TKI-resistant H2170 cells when compared to parental cells. GATA-6, a transcriptional activator of Wnt, was also found to be upregulated in resistant H2170 cells. In H2170 erlotinib resistant cells, upregulation of inactive GSK3β (p-GSK3β) was observed, indicating activation of Wnt and mTOR pathways which are otherwise inhibited by its active form. However, in H1975 cells, Wnt modulators such as active β-catenin, GATA-6 and p-GSK3β were downregulated. Additional results from MTT cell viability assays demonstrated that H1975 cell proliferation was not significantly decreased after Wnt inhibition by XAV939 , but combination treatment with everolimus ( mTOR inhibitor ) and erlotinib resulted in synergistic cell growth inhibition . Thus, in H2170 cells and H1975 cells, simultaneous inhibition of key Wnt or mTOR pathway proteins in addition to EGFR and c-Met may be a promising strategy for overcoming EGFR and c-Met TKI resistance in NSCLC patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26301867/", "doc_id": "bb7ddd4997f0951a2d47cc6d0d000cc5"}

This report reviews the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, agents that inhibit tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), when used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults. ### Data Sources Electronic databases were searched up to February 2005. ### Review Methods Systematic reviews of the literature on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were undertaken and industry submissions to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) were reviewed. Meta-analyses of effectiveness data were also undertaken for each agent. The Birmingham Rheumatoid Arthritis Model (BRAM), a simulation model, was further developed and used to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. ### results Twenty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), most of high quality, were included. The only head-to-head comparisons were against methotrexate. For patients with short disease duration (<or=3 years) who were naïve to methotrexate, adalimumab was marginally less and etanercept was marginally more effective than methotrexate in reducing symptoms of RA. etanercept was better tolerated than methotrexate. Both adalimumab and etanercept were more effective than methotrexate in slowing radiographic joint damage . etanercept was also marginally more effective and better tolerated than methotrexate in patients with longer disease durations who had not failed methotrexate treatment. infliximab is only licensed for use with methotrexate. All three agents, either alone (where so licensed) or in combination with ongoing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), were effective in reducing the symptoms and signs of RA in patients with established disease. At the licensed dose, the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) (95% CI) required to produce an American College for Rheumatology (ACR) response compared with placebo were: ACR20: adalimumab 3.6 (3.1 to 4.2), etanercept 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4), infliximab 3.2 (2.7 to 4.0); ACR50: adalimumab 4.2 (3.7 to 5.0), etanercept 3.1 (2.7 to 3.6), infliximab 5.0 (3.8 to 6.7); and ACR70: adalimumab 7.7 (5.9 to 11.1), etanercept 7.7 (6.3 to 10.0), infliximab 11.1 (7.7 to 20.0). In patients who were naïve to methotrexate, or who had not previously failed methotrexate treatment, a TNF inhibitor combined with methotrexate was significantly more effective than methotrexate alone. infliximab combined with methotrexate had an increased risk of serious infections. All ten published economic evaluations met standard criteria for quality, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from being within established thresholds to being very high because of varying assumptions and parameters. All three sponsors who submitted economic models made assumptions favourable to their product. BRAM incorporates improvements in quality of life and mortality, but assumes no effect of TNF inhibitors on joint replacement. For use in accordance with current NICE guidance as the third DMARD in a sequence of DMARDs, the base-case ICER was around pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in early RA and pound50,000 per QALY in late RA. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were sensitive to the estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression while on TNF inhibitors and the effectiveness of DMARDs, but not to changes in mortality ratios per unit HAQ. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used last. The ICER for etanercept used last is pound24,000 per QALY, substantially lower than for adalimumab ( pound30,000 per QALY) or infliximab ( pound38,000 per QALY). First line use as monotherapy generates ICERs around pound50,000 per QALY for adalimumab and etanercept. Using the combination of methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor as first line treatment generates much higher ICERs, as it precludes subsequent use of methotrexate, which is cheap. The ICERs for sequential use are of the same order as using the TNF inhibitor alone. ### conclusions adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are effective treatments compared with placebo for RA patients who are not well controlled by conventional DMARDs, improving control of symptoms, improving physical function, and slowing radiographic changes in joints. The combination of a TNF inhibitor with methotrexate was more effective than methotrexate alone in early RA, although the clinical relevance of this additional benefit is yet to be established, particularly in view of the well-established effectiveness of MTX alone. An increased risk of serious infection cannot be ruled out for the combination of methotrexate with adalimumab or infliximab. The results of the economic evaluation based on BRAM are consistent with the observations from the review of clinical effectiveness, including the ranking of treatments. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used as last active therapy. In this analysis, other things being equal, etanercept may be the TNF inhibitor of choice, although this may also depend on patient preference as to route of administration. The next most cost-effective use of TNF inhibitors is third line, as recommended in the 2002 NICE guidance. Direct comparative RCTs of TNF inhibitors against each other and against other DMARDs, and sequential use in patients who have failed a previous TNF inhibitor, are needed. Longer term studies of the quality of life in patients with RA and the impact of DMARDs on this are needed, as are longer studies that directly assess effects on joint replacement, other morbidity and mortality.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17049139/", "doc_id": "68c9547776b2824a3e90e1f59b9b4366"}

The treatment paradigm of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed rapidly in recent years. In first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk patients , the CheckMate 214 study demonstrated a significant survival advantage for nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib . The high cost of combined immune-modulating agents warrants an understanding of the combination's value by considering both efficacy and cost. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab compared with sunitinib for first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk advanced RCC from the U.S. payer perspective. ### Materials And Methods A Markov model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab with those of sunitinib in the first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk advanced RCC. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Drug costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates in 2017. We extrapolated survival beyond the trial closure using Weibull distribution. Model robustness was addressed in univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. ### results The total mean cost per-patient of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib was $292,308 and $169,287, respectfully. nivolumab and ipilimumab generated a gain of 0.978 QALYs over sunitinib. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for nivolumab and ipilimumab was $125,739/QALY versus sunitinib. ### conclusion Our analysis established that the base case ICER in the model for nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib is below what some would consider the upper limit of the theoretical willingness-to-pay threshold in the U.S. ($150,000/QALY) and is thus estimated to be cost-effective. ### Implications For Practice This article assessed the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib for treatment of patients with intermediate- to poor-risk metastatic kidney cancer, from the U.S. payer perspective. It would cost $125,739 to gain 1 quality-adjusted life-year with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib in these patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30710066/", "doc_id": "fac270cf9d9f839bc49728d2d4f38fc7"}

Taxanes are one of the most powerful classes of compounds among all chemotherapeutic drugs. Only 30 years separate the isolation of the first taxane from the results of direct clinical comparisons in metastatic breast, ovarian, and lung cancer between the two taxanes available in routine clinical practice. These results suggest a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio for docetaxel compared to paclitaxel when these drugs are used as single agents or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in an every-3-week dosing regimen. Pharmacological data support the difference between the taxanes, likely explaining the clinical results. Considering the molecular pharmacology of the two drugs, docetaxel appears to bind to beta-tubulin with greater affinity and has a wider cell cycle activity than paclitaxel. docetaxel also appears to have direct antitumoral activity via an apoptotic effect mediated by bcl-2 phosphorylation. In addition , docetaxel has a longer retention time in tumor cells than paclitaxel because of greater uptake and slower efflux . Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the taxanes show both agents to be extensively metabolized in the liver, and paclitaxel has a nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior while docetaxel has linear pharmacokinetics. These differences explain the more simple treatment schedule and favorable results for docetaxel as a single agent and in combination therapy. Last, but not least, there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between paclitaxel and the anthracyclines, an active class of compounds commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer. This pharmacokinetic interaction is associated with greater cardio- and myelotoxicities, which are sequence dependent. These pharmacological data likely explain the different clinical development strategies for the two molecules as well as the different clinical results from individual trials and direct comparisons.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15161985/", "doc_id": "b050c4f05066a38a88314ba7a6cf1d3a"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate the combined effects of simvastatin and exemestane on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells . The anti-proliferative effects of simvastatin and exemestane, alone and in combination, on the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were assessed by MTT assay. The synergism between the two drugs was determined in vitro using the combination index (CI) analysis. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, and alterations to the signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells were examined by immunoblotting following treatment with various regimens. The results of the MTT assay indicated that the combined treatment of simvastatin and exemestane significantly decreased the viability of MCF-7 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) human breast cancer cells, as compared with those that were treated with the individual drugs (CI<1). In addition, coadministration of exemestane and simvastatin was shown to result in marked inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, significant cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and induction of apoptosis, as compared with that of the control and individual drug-treated cells. Furthermore, the results of the present study indicated that these synergistic effects may be associated with the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein apoptotic pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6 kinase growth pathway. The combination of exemestane and simvastatin generated synergistic effects on MCF-7 ER+ breast cancer cells, indicating that the combination of these drugs may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The combination of the two inhibitors markedly increased the efficacy, as compared with the single-agent treatment, suggesting that combination treatment could become a highly effective approach for breast cancer. The results of the present study suggested that this combination of drugs has therapeutic potential, and requires further mechanistic and biomarker investigations in clinical trials.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25738757/", "doc_id": "3bc93c0827679996e6c214c767d3824d"}

Treatment and morbidity control of schistosomiasis relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), and the selection of resistant worms under repeated treatment is a concern. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the molecular effects of PZQ on schistosomes and to investigate alternative or synergistic drugs against schistosomiasis. ### methodology We used a custom-designed Schistosoma mansoni expression microarray to explore the effects of sublethal doses of PZQ on large-scale gene expression of adult paired males and females and unpaired mature females. We also assessed the efficacy of PZQ, omeprazole (OMP) or their combination against S. mansoni adult worms with a survival in vitro assay. ### Principal Findings We identified sets of genes that were affected by PZQ in paired and unpaired mature females, however with opposite gene expression patterns (up-regulated in paired and down-regulated in unpaired mature females), indicating that PZQ effects are heavily influenced by the mating status. We also identified genes that were similarly affected by PZQ in males and females. Functional analyses of gene interaction networks were performed with parasite genes that were differentially expressed upon PZQ treatment, searching for proteins encoded by these genes whose human homologs are targets of different drugs used for other diseases. Based on these results, OMP, a widely prescribed proton pump inhibitor known to target the ATP1A2 gene product, was chosen and tested. Sublethal doses of PZQ combined with OMP significantly increased worm mortality in vitro when compared with PZQ or OMP alone, thus evidencing a synergistic effect. ### conclusions Functional analysis of gene interaction networks is an important approach that can point to possible novel synergistic drug candidates. We demonstrated the potential of this strategy by showing that PZQ in combination with OMP displayed increased efficiency against S. mansoni adult worms in vitro when compared with either drug alone.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26402251/", "doc_id": "65bcf2e8ba4bd0911cf6a8ed3352e2e9"}
