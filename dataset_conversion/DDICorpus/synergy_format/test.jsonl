A wide variation of pharmacokinetic parameters has been observed even in experimental studies.

Davis (White micromeria), Cumium cyminum (cumin), Mentha piperita (Peppermint) against different bacteria and fungi species, and (2) to discuss the in-vitro possible effects between the plants and antibiotics.  The microorganisms used were Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Bacillus brevis FMC 3, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Pseudomonas pyocyaneus DC 127, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067, Escherichia coil DM, Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Yersinia enterocolitica AU 19, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Streptococcus faecalis DC 74 bacteria, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae WET 136, Kluvyeromyces fragilis DC 98 fungi in this study.  The results indicated that essential oils of Rosmarinus officinalis, Coriandrum sativum L., Micromeria fruticosa (L.)  Druce subsp.  brachycalyx P.H.  Davis, Cumium cyminum L., Mentha piperita L.  were shown antimicrobial activity in the range of 7-60 mm 2 microl(-1) inhibition zone to the microorganisms tested, using disc diffusion method.  Standard antibiotic such as Gentamicin (10 microg), Cephalothin (30 microg), Ceftriaxone (10 microg), Nystatin (10 U) discs were used for comparison with the antimicrobial activities of essential oils of these plants.  In addition, antibacterial activity of essential oils of these plants was researched by effects when it was used together with these standard antibiotics in vitro.  However, antibacterial activity changed also by in vitro interactions between these standard antibiotics and essential oils of these plants.

Fenofibrate is a prodrug that is rapidly and completely hydrolyzed to fenofibric acid, the active moiety.  A new orally administered agent, fenofibric acid, was developed as an alternative to fenofibrate. Two separate studies were conducted to evaluate the bioequivalence of fenofibric acid relative to fenofibrate under fasted and fed (standard breakfast) conditions, characterize the pharmacokinetic profile, and assess the safety and tolerability of fenofibric acid.  In study 1 (fasted), during each study period, volunteers received a single 105-mg dose of fenofibric acid or single 145-mg dose of fenofibrate (depending on their randomization scheme) after an overnight fast (a minimum fast of 10 hours).  A 7-day washout period followed the first treatment period, after which the volunteers received the alternate treatment.  Study 2 followed a similar dosing scheme and differed only in that volunteers received their single dose after being fed a standard meal (575 calories, of which 36% were contributed by fat).  Serial blood samples in both studies were collected up to 72 hours after drug administration.  The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest for assessing bioequivalence were AUC(0-t), AUC(0-   ), C(max), and T(max).  The criterion for a lack of difference between products was a 90% CI between 0.80 and 1.25 for the fenofibric acid:fenofibrate ratios for AUC(0-t), AUC(0-   ), and C(max.)  Tolerability was assessed by adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters, vital signs, and physical examinations.  Volunteers in study 1 (fasted; n = 54) were aged 18 to 43 years;  19 (35%) were men and 35 (65%) were women;  mean weight was 155.2 pounds (range, 103.0-267.0 pounds);  and 48 (89%) were white, 1 (2%) was black, and 5 (9%) were white/American Indian/Alaskan native/Asian.  Volunteers in study 2 (fed; n = 54) were aged 18 to 43 years;  27 (50%) were men and 27 (50%) were women;  mean weight was 161.9 pounds (range, 112.0-225.0 pounds);  and 51 (94%) were white (including 2 Hispanic) and 3 (6%) were black.  The 90% CIs about the ratio of the fenofibric acid geometric mean to the fenofibrate geometric mean were within the 80% and 125% limits for the pharmacokinetic parameters C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-   ) of the ln-transformed data in both study 1 (fasted) and study 2.  In study 1 (fasted), 14 volunteers (26%) experienced a total of 29 AEs;  the most common nonlaboratory AEs were dizziness (6%) and headache (4%).  In study 2, 12 volunteers (22%) experienced a total of 19 AEs;  the most common nonlaboratory AEs were headache (17%) and dry throat (4%).  AEs were generally mild or moderate in intensity.  In these 2 single-dose studies, these healthy volunteers administered a single oral dose of 105-mg fenofibric acid met the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence to a single oral dose of 145-mg fenofibrate tablets with respect to the rate and extent of fenofibric acid absorption in both fed and fasted states.

Fenofibrate is a prodrug that is rapidly and completely hydrolyzed to fenofibric acid, the active moiety.  A new orally administered agent, fenofibric acid, was developed as an alternative to fenofibrate.

The 90% CIs about the ratio of the fenofibric acid geometric mean to the fenofibrate geometric mean were within the 80% and 125% limits for the pharmacokinetic parameters C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-   ) of the ln-transformed data in both study 1 (fasted) and study 2.  In study 1 (fasted), 14 volunteers (26%) experienced a total of 29 AEs;  the most common nonlaboratory AEs were dizziness (6%) and headache (4%).  In study 2, 12 volunteers (22%) experienced a total of 19 AEs;  the most common nonlaboratory AEs were headache (17%) and dry throat (4%).  AEs were generally mild or moderate in intensity.  In these 2 single-dose studies, these healthy volunteers administered a single oral dose of 105-mg fenofibric acid met the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence to a single oral dose of 145-mg fenofibrate tablets with respect to the rate and extent of fenofibric acid absorption in both fed and fasted states.  Fenofibric acid at the dose studied was well tolerated in this population."}

However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol.  In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis.  It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment.

Conventional therapeutic drug monitoring based on measuring immunosupressive drug concentrations in blood is important in the clinical management of immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation medicine.  Since rejection or infection occurs at irregular drug concentrations immunosuppressive drug therapy is often empiric and prophylactic in nature.  In addition, blood immunosuppressant levels are only indirect predictors of the pharmacologic effects on immune cells, because the genetic heterogeneity the immune systems of transplant recipients are not equally sensitive to drug effects.  Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring requires the application of reliable and effective methods to study the pharmacodynamic variability by direct measurements of drug effects on immune cell functions.  Flow cytometry offers a multiplicity of quantitative analysis possibilities, from detection of phosphorylated molecules up to complex multicolor analysis of whole blood samples.  A large spectrum of flow cytometry-based applications for pharmacodynamic monitoring is available and allows detection and analysis of diverse function of T cells and dendritic cell subsets.  By combining several assays, it is possible to generate a broad picture of the immune status of every single transplanted recipient.  Furthermore, it is even possible to differentiate between synergistic and antagonistic pharmacodynamic effects of immunosuppressive drug combination therapy in vitro and to predict the pharmacodynamic drug effects in transplanted recipients.  Such a pharmacodynamic drug monitoring may offer the opportunity to complete conventional therapeutic drug monitoring and, therefore, to tailor immunosuppressive therapy more individually."}

We concluded that the combined administration of dexmedetomidine with ephedrine may have beneficial effects in the treatment of pain without causing sedation, which limits the use of dexmedetomidine as an analgesic in humans."}

Thus, the identification of putative inhibitors of bioactivation, as well as the determination of the protective role of oxidant defenses, on DEB-induced toxicity, can help to understand what is failing in FA cells.  In the present work we studied the contribution of several biochemical pathways for DEB-induced acute toxicity in human lymphocyte suspensions, by using inhibitors of epoxide hydrolases, inhibitors of protective enzymes as glutathione S-transferase and catalase, the depletion of glutathione (GSH), and the inhibition of protein synthesis;  and a variety of putative protective compounds, including antioxidants, and mitochondrial protective agents.  The present study reports two novel findings: (i) it was clearly evidenced, for the first time, that the acute exposure of freshly isolated human lymphocytes to DEB results in severe GSH depletion and loss of ATP, followed by cell death;  (ii) acetyl-l-carnitine elicits a significant protective effect on DEB induced toxicity, which was potentiated by  alpha-lipoic acid.

Effective strategies are needed to enhance paclitaxel sensitivity. A library of silencing RNAs (siRNAs) was used to identify kinases that regulate paclitaxel sensitivity in human ovarian cancer SKOv3 cells.  The effect of dasatinib, an inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases, on paclitaxel sensitivity was measured in ovarian cancer cells and HEY xenografts.  The roles of p27(Kip1), Bcl-2, and Cdk1 in apoptosis induced by dasatinib and paclitaxel were assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, siRNA knockdown of gene expression, transfection with Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression vectors, and flow cytometry.

After 21 weeks of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment, all 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated animals displayed parkinsonian symptoms, whereas none of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated monkeys were significantly affected.  These behavioural observations were consistent with in vivo positron emission tomography dopamine transporter imaging data, and with post-mortem stereological counts of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, as well as striatal intensity measurements of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, which were all significantly higher in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated animals than in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated monkeys.

In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated animals, almost 40% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive norepinephrine neurons was found in locus coeruleus/A5/A7 noradrenaline cell groups, whereas the extent of neuronal loss was lower than 15% of control values in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated monkeys.

It is known to possess both anticancer and antibacterial activity.  Such observations prompted to investigate the ability of methylglyoxal as a potent drug against multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  A total of 12 test P.  aeruginosa strains isolated from various hospitals were tested for their resistances against many antibiotics, most of which are applied in the treatment of P.  aeruginosa infections.  Results revealed that the strains were resistant to many drugs at high levels, only piperacillin, carbenicillin, amikacin and ciprofloxacin showed resistances at comparatively lower levels.  Following multiple experimentations it was observed that methylglyoxal was also antimicrobic against all the strains at comparable levels.  Distinct and statistically significant synergism was observed between methylglyoxal and piperacillin by disc diffusion tests when compared with their individual effects.  The fractional inhibitory concentration index of this combination evaluated by checkerboard analysis, was 0.5, which confirmed synergism between the pair.

"paragraph": "Although MIVACRON (a mixture of three stereoisomers) has been administered safely following succinylcholine-facilitated tracheal intubation, the interaction between MIVACRON and succinylcholine has not been systematically studied.  Prior administration of succinylcholine can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing agents.  Evidence of spontaneous recovery from succinylcholine should be observed before the administration of MIVACRON.  The use of MIVACRON before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied.  There are no clinical data on the use of MIVACRON with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.  Isoflurane and enflurane (administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 M.C.  decrease the ED50 of MIVACRON by as much as 25% (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Individualization of Dosages).  These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement of MIVACRON by as much as 35% to 40%.  A greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of MIVACRON may be expected with higher concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane.  Halothane has little or no effect on the ED50 , but may prolong the duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 20%.  Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as MIVACRON include certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.  The neuromuscular blocking effect of MIVACRON may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase . Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine.  While the effects of chronic phenytoin or carbamazepine therapy on the action of MIVACRON are unknown, slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher.  Some drug interactions are:  - birth control pills - corticosteroids - medicines for angina or high blood pressure - medicines for pain - medicines to control seizures such as phenytoin or carbamazepine - certain antibiotics given by injection - cisplatin - edrophonium - neostigmine - polymyxin B or bacitracin - local anesthetics such as procaine - general anesthetics - succinylcholine or other muscle relaxants"}

If diuretics cannot be interrupted, close medical supervision should be provided with the first dose of ACEON    Tablets, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour.  The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics.  The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition.  Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: ACEON    Tablets may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production.  Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia.  Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently.  Lithium: Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy.  These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended.  Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity.  Digoxin: A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when coadministered with ACEON    Tablets, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded.  Gentamicin: Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin.  However, this has not been investigated in human studies.  Coadministration of both drugs should proceed with caution.  Food Interaction: Oral administration of ACEON    Tablets with food does not significantly lower the rate or extent of perindopril absorption relative to the fasted state.  However, the extent of biotransformation of perindopril to the active metabolite, perindoprilat, is reduced approximately 43%, resulting in a reduction in the plasma ACE inhibition curve of approximately 20%, probably clinically insignificant.  In clinical trials, perindopril was generally administered in a non-fasting state.        "}

Amantadine: Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that amantadine is unlikely to alter the oral clearance of pramipexole (N= 54).

Probenecid: Probenecid, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic acids via the aruonic transporter, did not noticeably influence pramipexole pharmacokinetics (N= 12).  Other drugs eliminated via renal secretion: Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that coadministration of drugs that are secreted by the cationic transport system (e.g., cimetidine, ranitidine, diltiazem, triamterene, verapamil, quinidine, and quinine) decreases the oral clearance of pramipexole by about 20%, while those secreted by the anionic transport system (e.g., cephalosporins, penicillins, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorpropamide) are likely to have little effect on the oral clearance of pramipexole.  CYP interactions: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes would not be expected to affect pramipexole elimination because pramipexole is not appreciably metabolized by these enzymes in vivo or in vitro.  Pramipexole does not inhibit CYP enzymes CYPIA2, CYP2C9, CYP2CI9, CYP2EI, and CYP3A4.  Inhibition of CYP2D6 was observed with an apparent Ki of 30 uM, indicating that pramipexole will not inhibit CYP enzymes at plasma concentrations observed following the highest recommended clinical dose (1.5 mg tid).  Dopamine antagonists: Since pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of MIRAPEX.

Other drugs eliminated via renal secretion: Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that coadministration of drugs that are secreted by the cationic transport system (e.g., cimetidine, ranitidine, diltiazem, triamterene, verapamil, quinidine, and quinine) decreases the oral clearance of pramipexole by about 20%, while those secreted by the anionic transport system (e.g., cephalosporins, penicillins, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorpropamide) are likely to have little effect on the oral clearance of pramipexole.  CYP interactions: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes would not be expected to affect pramipexole elimination because pramipexole is not appreciably metabolized by these enzymes in vivo or in vitro.  Pramipexole does not inhibit CYP enzymes CYPIA2, CYP2C9, CYP2CI9, CYP2EI, and CYP3A4.  Inhibition of CYP2D6 was observed with an apparent Ki of 30 uM, indicating that pramipexole will not inhibit CYP enzymes at plasma concentrations observed following the highest recommended clinical dose (1.5 mg tid).  Dopamine antagonists: Since pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of MIRAPEX.

Inhibition of CYP2D6 was observed with an apparent Ki of 30 uM, indicating that pramipexole will not inhibit CYP enzymes at plasma concentrations observed following the highest recommended clinical dose (1.5 mg tid).  Dopamine antagonists: Since pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of MIRAPEX.  Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions There are no known interactions between MIRAPEX and laboratory tests."}

Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.  Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, or CYP2C19.  No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers.  The elevation of prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of Exelon.  Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Exelon: Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine.  Single dose pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of rivastigmine is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine.  Population PK analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine were not influenced by commonly prescribed medications such as antacids (n=77), antihypertensives (n=72), calcium channel blockers (n=75), antidiabetics (n=21), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n=79), estrogens (n=70), salicylate analgesics (n=177), antianginals (n=35), and antihistamines (n=15).

Due to the slow elimination of mifepristone from the body, such interaction may be observed for a prolonged period after its administration.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when mifepristone is administered with drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates and have narrow therapeutic range, including some agents used during general anesthesia."}

Interference with spectrophotometric methods for SGOT analysis has not been reported.  Since methyldopa causes fluorescence in urine samples at the same wave lengths as catecholamines, falsely high levels of urinary catecholamines may be reported.

Drugs such as erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole were shown to significantly increase the C max and AUC of orally administered midazolam.  These drug interactions may result in increased and prolonged sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam.  Although not studied, the potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors ritonavir and nelfinavir may cause intense and prolonged sedation and respiratory depression due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam.  Caution is advised when VERSED Syrup is used concomitantly with these drugs.  Dose adjustments should be considered and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated.  Inducers of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, induce metabolism and caused a markedly decreased C max and AUC of oral midazolam in adult studies.  Although clinical studies have not been performed, phenobarbital is expected to have the same effect.  Caution is advised when administering VERSED Syrup to patients receiving these medications and if necessary dose adjustments should be considered.  The difficulty in achieving adequate sedation may have been the result of decreased absorption of the sedatives due to both the gastrointestinal effects and stimulant effects of methylphenidate.  The sedative effect of VERSED Syrup is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication which depresses the central nervous system, particularly narcotics (eg, morphine, meperidine and fentanyl), propofol, ketamine, nitrous oxide, secobarbital and droperidol.

DIFLUCAN reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide, glyburide, and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents.  When DIFLUCAN is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents, blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary.  Coumarin-type anticoagulants: Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants.  In post-marketing experience, as with other azole antifungals, bleeding events (bruising, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and melena) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole concurrently with warfarin.  Careful monitoring of prothrombin time in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants is recommended.  (See <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.)  Phenytoin: DIFLUCAN increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin.  Careful monitoring of phenytoin concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and phenytoin is recommended.  (See <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.)  Cyclosporine: DIFLUCAN may significantly increase cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients with or without renal impairment.  Careful monitoring of cyclosporine concentrations and serum creatinine is recommended in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and cyclosporine.  (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.)  Rifampin: Rifampin enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered DIFLUCAN.  Depending on clinical circumstances, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of DIFLUCAN when it is administered with rifampin.  Theophylline: DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline.  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended.  Terfenadine: Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed.  One study at a 200-mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval.  Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.  Cisapride: There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered.  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.  Astemizole: The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs.  In the absence of definitive information, caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole.  Patients should be carefully monitored.  Rifabutin: There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered.  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Tacrolimus: There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered.  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.  If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels;  however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels.  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation.  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism.  The clinical significance of these effects is presently unknown.  Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur."}

Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.  Cisapride: There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered.  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.  Astemizole: The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs.  In the absence of definitive information, caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole.  Patients should be carefully monitored.  Rifabutin: There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered.  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Tacrolimus: There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered.  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.  If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels;  however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels.  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation.  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism.  The clinical significance of these effects is presently unknown.  Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur."}

Theophylline: DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline.  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended.  Terfenadine: Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed.  One study at a 200-mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval.  Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.  Cisapride: There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered.  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.  Astemizole: The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs.  In the absence of definitive information, caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole.  Patients should be carefully monitored.  Rifabutin: There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered.  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Tacrolimus: There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered.  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.  If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels;  however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels.  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation.  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism.  The clinical significance of these effects is presently unknown.  Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur."}

Theophylline: DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline.  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended.  Terfenadine: Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed.  One study at a 200-mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval.  Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.  Cisapride: There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered.  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.  Astemizole: The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs.  In the absence of definitive information, caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole.  Patients should be carefully monitored.  Rifabutin: There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered.  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Tacrolimus: There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered.  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.  If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels;  however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels.  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation.  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism.  The clinical significance of these effects is presently unknown.  Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur."}

Depending on clinical circumstances, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of DIFLUCAN when it is administered with rifampin.  Theophylline: DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline.  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended.  Terfenadine: Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed.  One study at a 200-mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval.  Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.  Cisapride: There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered.  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.  Astemizole: The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs.  In the absence of definitive information, caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole.  Patients should be carefully monitored.  Rifabutin: There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered.  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Tacrolimus: There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered.  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.  If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels;  however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels.  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation.  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism.

Theophylline: DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline.  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended.  Terfenadine: Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed.  One study at a 200-mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval.  Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.  Cisapride: There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered.  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.  Astemizole: The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs.  In the absence of definitive information, caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole.  Patients should be carefully monitored.  Rifabutin: There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered.  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Tacrolimus: There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered.  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.  If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels;  however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels.  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation.  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism.  The clinical significance of these effects is presently unknown.  Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur."}

Theophylline: DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline.  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended.  Terfenadine: Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed.  One study at a 200-mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval.  Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.  Cisapride: There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered.  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.  Astemizole: The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs.  In the absence of definitive information, caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole.  Patients should be carefully monitored.  Rifabutin: There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered.  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Tacrolimus: There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered.  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.  If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels;  however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels.  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation.  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism.  The clinical significance of these effects is presently unknown.  Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur."}

DIFLUCAN reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide, glyburide, and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents.  When DIFLUCAN is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents, blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary.  Coumarin-type anticoagulants: Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants.  In post-marketing experience, as with other azole antifungals, bleeding events (bruising, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and melena) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole concurrently with warfarin.  Careful monitoring of prothrombin time in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants is recommended.  (See <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.)  Phenytoin: DIFLUCAN increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin.  Careful monitoring of phenytoin concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and phenytoin is recommended.  (See <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.)  Cyclosporine: DIFLUCAN may significantly increase cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients with or without renal impairment.  Careful monitoring of cyclosporine concentrations and serum creatinine is recommended in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and cyclosporine.  (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.)  Rifampin: Rifampin enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered DIFLUCAN.  Depending on clinical circumstances, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of DIFLUCAN when it is administered with rifampin.  Theophylline: DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline.  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended.  Terfenadine: Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed.  One study at a 200-mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval.  Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.  Cisapride: There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered.  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.  Astemizole: The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs.  In the absence of definitive information, caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole.  Patients should be carefully monitored.  Rifabutin: There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered.  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Tacrolimus: There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered.  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.  Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.  If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels;  however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels.  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation.  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism.  The clinical significance of these effects is presently unknown.  Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur."}

Aspirin: Concomitant administration of aspirin (1000 mg TID) to healthy volunteers tended to increase the AUC (10%) and Cmax (24%) of meloxicam.  The clinical significance of this interaction is not known;  however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of meloxicam and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.  Concomitant administration of low-dose aspirin with MOBIC may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of MOBIC alone.  MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.  Cholestyramine: Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%.  This resulted in a decrease in t1/2, from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC.  This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract.  The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established.  Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam.  Digoxin: Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b-acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses.  In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam.  Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients.  This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.  Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect.  Furosemide: single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam.  Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC, patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.  Lithium: In clinical trials, NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.  In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean pre-dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21% in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.  These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC.  Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn.  Methotrexate: A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly.  Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate.  In vitro, methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites.  Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding.  The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8.  In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time.  However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1.  Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced."}

This resulted in a decrease in t1/2, from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC.  This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract.  The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established.  Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam.  Digoxin: Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b-acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses.  In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam.  Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients.  This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.  Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect.  Furosemide: single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam.  Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC, patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.  Lithium: In clinical trials, NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.  In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean pre-dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21% in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.  These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC.  Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn.  Methotrexate: A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly.  Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate.  In vitro, methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites.  Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding.  The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8.  In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time.  However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1.  Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced."}

MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.  Cholestyramine: Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%.  This resulted in a decrease in t1/2, from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC.  This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract.  The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established.  Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam.  Digoxin: Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b-acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses.  In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam.  Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients.  This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.  Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect.  Furosemide: single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam.  Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC, patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.  Lithium: In clinical trials, NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.  In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean pre-dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21% in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.  These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC.  Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn.  Methotrexate: A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly.  Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate.  In vitro, methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites.  Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding.  The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8.  In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time.  However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1.  Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced."}

This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors.  Aspirin: Concomitant administration of aspirin (1000 mg TID) to healthy volunteers tended to increase the AUC (10%) and Cmax (24%) of meloxicam.  The clinical significance of this interaction is not known;  however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of meloxicam and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.  Concomitant administration of low-dose aspirin with MOBIC may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of MOBIC alone.  MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.  Cholestyramine: Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%.  This resulted in a decrease in t1/2, from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC.  This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract.  The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established.  Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam.  Digoxin: Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b-acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses.  In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam.  Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients.  This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.  Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect.  Furosemide: single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam.  Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC, patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.  Lithium: In clinical trials, NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.  In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean pre-dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21% in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.  These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC.  Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn.  Methotrexate: A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly.  Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate.  In vitro, methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites.  Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding.  The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8.  In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time.  However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1.

This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors.  Aspirin: Concomitant administration of aspirin (1000 mg TID) to healthy volunteers tended to increase the AUC (10%) and Cmax (24%) of meloxicam.  The clinical significance of this interaction is not known;  however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of meloxicam and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.  Concomitant administration of low-dose aspirin with MOBIC may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of MOBIC alone.  MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.  Cholestyramine: Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%.  This resulted in a decrease in t1/2, from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC.  This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract.  The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established.  Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam.  Digoxin: Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b-acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses.  In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam.  Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients.  This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.  Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect.  Furosemide: single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam.  Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC, patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.  Lithium: In clinical trials, NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.  In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean pre-dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21% in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.  These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC.  Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn.  Methotrexate: A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly.  Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate.  In vitro, methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites.  Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding.  The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8.  In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time.  However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1.  Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced."}

When oxandrolone therapy is initiated in a patient already receiving treatment with warfarin, the INR or prothrombin time (PT) should be monitored closely and the dose of warfarin adjusted as necessary until a stable target INR or PT has been achieved.  Furthermore, in patients receiving both drugs, careful monitoring of the INR or PT, and adjustment of the warfarin dosage if indicated are recommended when the oxandrolone dose is changed or discontinued.

Cyclosporine: The total ezetimibe level increased 12-fold in one renal transplant patient receiving multiple medications, including cyclosporine.  Patients who take both ezetimibe and cyclosporine should be carefully monitored.  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was conducted in rats at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day (males) and 500 mg/kg/day (females) (~20 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was also conducted in mice at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (>150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  There were no statistically significant increases in tumor incidences in drug-treated rats or mice.  No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro in a microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with or without metabolic activation.  No evidence of clastogenicity was observed in vitro in a chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation.  In addition, there was no evidence of genotoxicity in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.  In oral (gavage) fertility studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats, there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in male or female rats (~7 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  Pregnancy Pregnancy Category: C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ezetimibe in pregnant women.  Ezetimibe should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.  In oral (gavage) embryo-fetal development studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there was no evidence of embryolethal effects at the doses tested (250, 500, 1000 mg/kg/day).  In rats, increased incidences of common fetal skeletal findings (extra pair of thoracic ribs, unossified cervical vertebral centra, shortened ribs) were observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (~10 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  In rabbits treated with ezetimibe, an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  Ezetimibe crossed the placenta when pregnant rats and rabbits were given multiple oral doses.  Multiple dose studies of ezetimibe given in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures.  Reproductive findings occur at lower doses in combination therapy compared to monotherapy.  All HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women.  When ZETIA is administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in a woman of childbearing potential, refer to the pregnancy category and package labeling for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.  Labor and Delivery The effects of ZETIA on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.  Nursing Mothers In rat studies, exposure to total ezetimibe in nursing pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma.  It is not known whether ezetimibe is excreted into human breast milk;  therefore, ZETIA should not be used in nursing mothers unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant.  Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics of ZETIA in adolescents (10 to 18 years) have been shown to be similar to that in adults.  Treatment experience with ZETIA in the pediatric population is limited to 4 patients (9 to 17 years) in the sitosterolemia study and 5 patients (11 to 17 years) in the HoFH study.  Treatment with ZETIA in children (<10 years) is not recommended.  Geriatric Use Of the patients who received ZETIA in clinical studies, 948 were 65 and older (this included 206 who were 75 and older).  The effectiveness and safety of ZETIA were similar between these patients and younger subjects.  Greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."}

In rabbits treated with ezetimibe, an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  Ezetimibe crossed the placenta when pregnant rats and rabbits were given multiple oral doses.  Multiple dose studies of ezetimibe given in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures.  Reproductive findings occur at lower doses in combination therapy compared to monotherapy.  All HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women.  When ZETIA is administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in a woman of childbearing potential, refer to the pregnancy category and package labeling for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.  Labor and Delivery The effects of ZETIA on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.  Nursing Mothers In rat studies, exposure to total ezetimibe in nursing pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma.  It is not known whether ezetimibe is excreted into human breast milk;  therefore, ZETIA should not be used in nursing mothers unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant.  Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics of ZETIA in adolescents (10 to 18 years) have been shown to be similar to that in adults.  Treatment experience with ZETIA in the pediatric population is limited to 4 patients (9 to 17 years) in the sitosterolemia study and 5 patients (11 to 17 years) in the HoFH study.  Treatment with ZETIA in children (<10 years) is not recommended.  Geriatric Use Of the patients who received ZETIA in clinical studies, 948 were 65 and older (this included 206 who were 75 and older).  The effectiveness and safety of ZETIA were similar between these patients and younger subjects.  Greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."}

In rabbits treated with ezetimibe, an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  Ezetimibe crossed the placenta when pregnant rats and rabbits were given multiple oral doses.  Multiple dose studies of ezetimibe given in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures.  Reproductive findings occur at lower doses in combination therapy compared to monotherapy.  All HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women.  When ZETIA is administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in a woman of childbearing potential, refer to the pregnancy category and package labeling for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.  Labor and Delivery The effects of ZETIA on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.  Nursing Mothers In rat studies, exposure to total ezetimibe in nursing pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma.  It is not known whether ezetimibe is excreted into human breast milk;  therefore, ZETIA should not be used in nursing mothers unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant.  Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics of ZETIA in adolescents (10 to 18 years) have been shown to be similar to that in adults.  Treatment experience with ZETIA in the pediatric population is limited to 4 patients (9 to 17 years) in the sitosterolemia study and 5 patients (11 to 17 years) in the HoFH study.  Treatment with ZETIA in children (<10 years) is not recommended.  Geriatric Use Of the patients who received ZETIA in clinical studies, 948 were 65 and older (this included 206 who were 75 and older).  The effectiveness and safety of ZETIA were similar between these patients and younger subjects.  Greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."}

In a preclinical study in dogs, ezetimibe increased cholesterol in the gallbladder bile.  Co-administration of ZETIA with fibrates is not recommended until use in patients is studied.

Gemfibrozil: In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant gemfibrozil administration increased total ezetimibe concentrations approximately 1.7-fold.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were seen when ezetimibe was co-administered with atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, or fluvastatin.  Cyclosporine: The total ezetimibe level increased 12-fold in one renal transplant patient receiving multiple medications, including cyclosporine.  Patients who take both ezetimibe and cyclosporine should be carefully monitored.  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was conducted in rats at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day (males) and 500 mg/kg/day (females) (~20 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was also conducted in mice at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (>150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  There were no statistically significant increases in tumor incidences in drug-treated rats or mice.  No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro in a microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with or without metabolic activation.  No evidence of clastogenicity was observed in vitro in a chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation.  In addition, there was no evidence of genotoxicity in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.  In oral (gavage) fertility studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats, there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in male or female rats (~7 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  Pregnancy Pregnancy Category: C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ezetimibe in pregnant women.  Ezetimibe should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.  In oral (gavage) embryo-fetal development studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there was no evidence of embryolethal effects at the doses tested (250, 500, 1000 mg/kg/day).  In rats, increased incidences of common fetal skeletal findings (extra pair of thoracic ribs, unossified cervical vertebral centra, shortened ribs) were observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (~10 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  In rabbits treated with ezetimibe, an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).  Ezetimibe crossed the placenta when pregnant rats and rabbits were given multiple oral doses.  Multiple dose studies of ezetimibe given in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures.  Reproductive findings occur at lower doses in combination therapy compared to monotherapy.  All HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women.  When ZETIA is administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in a woman of childbearing potential, refer to the pregnancy category and package labeling for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.  Labor and Delivery The effects of ZETIA on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.  Nursing Mothers In rat studies, exposure to total ezetimibe in nursing pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma.  It is not known whether ezetimibe is excreted into human breast milk;  therefore, ZETIA should not be used in nursing mothers unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant.  Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics of ZETIA in adolescents (10 to 18 years) have been shown to be similar to that in adults.  Treatment experience with ZETIA in the pediatric population is limited to 4 patients (9 to 17 years) in the sitosterolemia study and 5 patients (11 to 17 years) in the HoFH study.  Treatment with ZETIA in children (<10 years) is not recommended.  Geriatric Use Of the patients who received ZETIA in clinical studies, 948 were 65 and older (this included 206 who were 75 and older).  The effectiveness and safety of ZETIA were similar between these patients and younger subjects.  Greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."}
