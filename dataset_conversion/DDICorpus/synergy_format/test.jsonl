The siRNA knockdown of p27(Kip1 ) decreased dasatinib - and paclitaxel - induced apoptosis compared with a negative control siRNA ( sub - G1 fraction , control siRNA vs. p27(Kip1 ) siRNA : 42.5 % vs. 20.1 % , difference = 22.4 % , 95 % CI = 20.1 % to 24.7 % , P = .017 ) .  Studies with forced expression and siRNA knockdown of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 suggest that dasatinib - mediated induction of p27(Kip1 ) enhanced paclitaxel - induced apoptosis by negatively regulating Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression .  Inhibition of Src family and Abl kinases with either siRNAs or dasatinib enhances paclitaxel sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells through p27(Kip1)-mediated suppression of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression .", "doc_id": "4d7f49b209be21fca3dbd7b1f8a84e1d"}

Rats treated with neonatal quinpirole enhanced time spent in the amphetamine - paired context compared with quinpirole - free controls conditioned with amphetamine , but only female controls conditioned with amphetamine spent more time in the drug - paired context compared with saline - treated controls .  Increased D   -like receptor sensitivity appears to have enhanced the behavioral effects of amphetamine , but these effects were more prevalent in adolescent female rats compared with male rats .", "doc_id": "44e58caf060a0cf0b06a2c989e55f639"}

METHODS AND AIMS : We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 40 end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patients ( age : 55    14 ; mean    SD ; 21 : male ) who had at least 12 months of cinacalcet therapy .  The distribution of renal replacement therapies were : 14 peritoneal dialysis , 18 conventional hemodialysis and 8 nocturnal hemodialysis .  Standard dialysis related biochemical indices and medications used were recorded .  The primary objective of the study was to ascertain the difference in darbepoetin responsiveness before and after 12 months of cinacalcet therapy .  Our secondary objective was to determine if there was a relationship between the changes in PTH and darbepoetin requirement . Overall , PTH levels decreased from 197.5 ( 151.8 ; 249.2 ) to 66.1 ( 41.2 ; 136.5 ) ( median ( 25th;75th percentile ) ) pmol / l ;  p & lt ;  0.001 .  Cinacalcet dose increased from 30.0   6 to 63   25 mg / day , p < 0.05 .  Hemoglobin remained unchanged ( 116   13 to 116   13 g / l ) , while darbepoetin requirement decreased from 40 ( 20 ; 60 ) to 24 ( 19 ; 59 )   g / week , p = 0.02 . The remainder of the dialysis - related biochemistry ( electrolytes , calcium , phosphate , iron status ) and vitamin D use remained unchanged .  A reduction in PTH level of greater than 30 % was experienced by 82.5 % ( 33/40 ) of our cohort .  Among the responders , the fall in PTH and reduction darbepoetin requirement were related ( R = -0.48 , p = 0.004 ) .  Reduction of PTH by cinacalcet is associated with a decrease in darbepoetin requirement .  The interface between bone and bone marrow in uremia represents a critical step in red blood cell production which merits further investigation .", "doc_id": "63c7fb2a64b39955f8fa7ca12ec34dc0"}

The interaction was studied at neutral , acidic and basic conditions both at room temperature and 37  C.  The effect of dissolution medium simulating various body environments with response to pH has been examined in order to elucidate the interactions .  The response of moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin after interaction with co - administered drugs at different conditions and temperature were noted using a Shimadzu HPLC system with PDA detector .  It was seen that interaction of these fluoroquinolones was more at 37  C than at room temperature .  Moxifloxacin and Lomefloxacin reacts faster with sucralfate and gelusil in acidic media whereas with erythromycin in basic media and multi-minerals in neutral media .  The study ensures the interaction of fluoroquinolones with selected class of drugs .  In order to achieve the effective therapeutic effect appropriate time intervals between administrations of drugs is essential .", "doc_id": "290f134ee42ac839acf1704b4afd39bd"}

The pharmacokinetics of rimantadine were assessed on days 11 and 13 .  Coadministration with acetaminophen reduced the peak concentration and AUC values for rimantadine by approximately 11 % .  Aspirin : Rimantadine HCl , 100 mg , was given twice daily fro 13 days to 12 healthy volunteers .  On day 11 , aspirin ( 650 mg , four times daily ) was started and continued for 8 days .  The pharmacokinetics of rimantadine were assessed on days 11 and 13 .  Peak plasma concentrations and AUC of rimantadine were reduced approximately 10 % in the presence of aspirin .", "doc_id": "1a159ca5c2f4a6d0e93be3799d5b4c30"}

Isoflurane and enflurane ( administered with nitrous oxide / oxygen to achieve 1.25 M.C.  decrease the ED50 of MIVACRON by as much as 25 % ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacodynamics and Individualization of Dosages ) .  These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement of MIVACRON by as much as 35 % to 40 % .  A greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of MIVACRON may be expected with higher concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane .  Halothane has little or no effect on the ED50 , but may prolong the duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 20 % .  Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as MIVACRON include certain antibiotics ( e.g. , aminoglycosides , tetracyclines , bacitracin , polymyxins , lincomycin , clindamycin , colistin , and sodium colistimethate ) , magnesium salts , lithium , local anesthetics , procainamide , and quinidine .  The neuromuscular blocking effect of MIVACRON may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity ( e.g. , chronically administered oral contraceptives , glucocorticoids , or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors ) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase . Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine .  While the effects of chronic phenytoin or carbamazepine therapy on the action of MIVACRON are unknown , slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher .  Some drug interactions are :  - birth control pills - corticosteroids - medicines for angina or high blood pressure - medicines for pain - medicines to control seizures such as phenytoin or carbamazepine - certain antibiotics given by injection - cisplatin - edrophonium - neostigmine - polymyxin B or bacitracin - local anesthetics such as procaine - general anesthetics - succinylcholine or other muscle relaxants", "doc_id": "73620bdb6b60bf67ce4d308d6893d053"}

"paragraph": "Although MIVACRON ( a mixture of three stereoisomers ) has been administered safely following succinylcholine - facilitated tracheal intubation , the interaction between MIVACRON and succinylcholine has not been systematically studied .  Prior administration of succinylcholine can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing agents .  Evidence of spontaneous recovery from succinylcholine should be observed before the administration of MIVACRON .  The use of MIVACRON before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied .  There are no clinical data on the use of MIVACRON with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents .  Isoflurane and enflurane ( administered with nitrous oxide / oxygen to achieve 1.25 M.C.  decrease the ED50 of MIVACRON by as much as 25 % ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacodynamics and Individualization of Dosages ) .  These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement of MIVACRON by as much as 35 % to 40 % .  A greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of MIVACRON may be expected with higher concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane .  Halothane has little or no effect on the ED50 , but may prolong the duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 20 % .  Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as MIVACRON include certain antibiotics ( e.g. , aminoglycosides , tetracyclines , bacitracin , polymyxins , lincomycin , clindamycin , colistin , and sodium colistimethate ) , magnesium salts , lithium , local anesthetics , procainamide , and quinidine .  The neuromuscular blocking effect of MIVACRON may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity ( e.g. , chronically administered oral contraceptives , glucocorticoids , or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors ) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase . Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine .  While the effects of chronic phenytoin or carbamazepine therapy on the action of MIVACRON are unknown , slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher .  Some drug interactions are :  - birth control pills - corticosteroids - medicines for angina or high blood pressure - medicines for pain - medicines to control seizures such as phenytoin or carbamazepine - certain antibiotics given by injection - cisplatin - edrophonium - neostigmine - polymyxin B or bacitracin - local anesthetics such as procaine - general anesthetics - succinylcholine or other muscle relaxants", "doc_id": "ec5da87324afa47064c43c5c6891f3ae"}

This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors .  Aspirin : Concomitant administration of aspirin ( 1000 mg TID ) to healthy volunteers tended to increase the AUC ( 10 % ) and Cmax ( 24 % ) of meloxicam .  The clinical significance of this interaction is not known ;  however , as with other NSAIDs , concomitant administration of meloxicam and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects .  Concomitant administration of low - dose aspirin with MOBIC may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications , compared to use of MOBIC alone .  MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis .  Cholestyramine : Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50 % .  This resulted in a decrease in t1/2 , from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours , and a 35 % reduction in AUC .  This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract .  The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established .  Cimetidine : Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single - dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam .  Digoxin : Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b - acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses .  In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam .  Furosemide : Clinical studies , as well as post - marketing observations , have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients .  This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis .  Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect .  Furosemide : single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam .  Nevertheless , during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC , patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function , as well as to assure diuretic efficacy .  Lithium : In clinical trials , NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance .  In a study conducted in healthy subjects , mean pre - dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21 % in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone .  These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC .  Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn .  Methotrexate : A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly .  Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate .  In vitro , methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites .  Warfarin : Anticoagulant activity should be monitored , particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents , since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding .  The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) between 1.2 and 1.8 .  In these subjects , meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time .  However , one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1 .  Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced .", "doc_id": "91545a1515f1811fffab382ef9b116db"}

Furosemide : Clinical studies , as well as post - marketing observations , have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients .  This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis .  Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect .

These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC .  Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn .  Methotrexate : A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly .  Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate .  In vitro , methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites .  Warfarin : Anticoagulant activity should be monitored , particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents , since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding .  The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) between 1.2 and 1.8 .  In these subjects , meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time .  However , one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1 .  Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced .", "doc_id": "22f5ccd13f770f95f235cb965d959795"}

DIFLUCAN reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide , glyburide , and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents .  When DIFLUCAN is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents , blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary .  Coumarin-type anticoagulants : Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants .  In post - marketing experience , as with other azole antifungals , bleeding events ( bruising , epistaxis , gastrointestinal bleeding , hematuria , and melena ) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole concurrently with warfarin .  Careful monitoring of prothrombin time in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants is recommended .  ( See < a href= \" flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interaction Studies . )  Phenytoin : DIFLUCAN increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin .  Careful monitoring of phenytoin concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and phenytoin is recommended .  ( See < a href= \" flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interaction Studies . )  Cyclosporine : DIFLUCAN may significantly increase cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients with or without renal impairment .  Careful monitoring of cyclosporine concentrations and serum creatinine is recommended in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and cyclosporine .  ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interaction Studies . )  Rifampin : Rifampin enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered DIFLUCAN .  Depending on clinical circumstances , consideration should be given to increasing the dose of DIFLUCAN when it is administered with rifampin .  Theophylline : DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline .  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended .  Terfenadine : Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine , interaction studies have been performed .  One study at a 200 - mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval .  Another study at a 400 - mg and 800 - mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly .  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated .  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg / day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored .  Cisapride : There have been reports of cardiac events , including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered .  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval . The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated .  Astemizole : The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs .  In the absence of definitive information , caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole .  Patients should be carefully monitored .  Rifabutin : There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered .  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored .  Tacrolimus : There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered .  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored .  Short-acting Benzodiazepines : Following oral administration of midazolam , fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects .  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously .  If short-acting benzodiazepines , which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system , are concomitantly administered with fluconazole , consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage , and the patients should be appropriately monitored .  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol - and levonorgestrel - containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels ;  however , in some patients there were decreases up to 47 % and 33 % of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels .  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation .  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel , there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism .

The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated .  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg / day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored .  Cisapride : There have been reports of cardiac events , including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered .  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval . The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated .  Astemizole : The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs .

Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol - and levonorgestrel - containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels ;  however , in some patients there were decreases up to 47 % and 33 % of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels .  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation .  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel , there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism .

The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated .  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg / day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored .  Cisapride : There have been reports of cardiac events , including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered .  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval . The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated .  Astemizole : The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs .

Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol - and levonorgestrel - containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels ;  however , in some patients there were decreases up to 47 % and 33 % of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels .  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation .

Coumarin-type anticoagulants : Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants .  In post - marketing experience , as with other azole antifungals , bleeding events ( bruising , epistaxis , gastrointestinal bleeding , hematuria , and melena ) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole concurrently with warfarin .  Careful monitoring of prothrombin time in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants is recommended .  ( See < a href= \" flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interaction Studies . )  Phenytoin : DIFLUCAN increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin .  Careful monitoring of phenytoin concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and phenytoin is recommended .  ( See < a href= \" flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interaction Studies . )  Cyclosporine : DIFLUCAN may significantly increase cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients with or without renal impairment .  Careful monitoring of cyclosporine concentrations and serum creatinine is recommended in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and cyclosporine .  ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interaction Studies . )  Rifampin : Rifampin enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered DIFLUCAN .  Depending on clinical circumstances , consideration should be given to increasing the dose of DIFLUCAN when it is administered with rifampin .  Theophylline : DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline .  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended .  Terfenadine : Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine , interaction studies have been performed .  One study at a 200 - mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval .  Another study at a 400 - mg and 800 - mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly .  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated .  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg / day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored .  Cisapride : There have been reports of cardiac events , including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered .  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval . The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated .  Astemizole : The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs .  In the absence of definitive information , caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole .  Patients should be carefully monitored .  Rifabutin : There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered .  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored .  Tacrolimus : There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered .  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored .  Short-acting Benzodiazepines : Following oral administration of midazolam , fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects .  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously .  If short-acting benzodiazepines , which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system , are concomitantly administered with fluconazole , consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage , and the patients should be appropriately monitored .  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol - and levonorgestrel - containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels ;  however , in some patients there were decreases up to 47 % and 33 % of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels .  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation .  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel , there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism .  The clinical significance of these effects is presently unknown .  Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the < a href= \" flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted , but such interactions may occur .", "doc_id": "24f25a86fdd0cd8600539ae045608a1a"}

DIFLUCAN reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide , glyburide , and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents .  When DIFLUCAN is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents , blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary .  Coumarin-type anticoagulants : Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants .  In post - marketing experience , as with other azole antifungals , bleeding events ( bruising , epistaxis , gastrointestinal bleeding , hematuria , and melena ) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole concurrently with warfarin .  Careful monitoring of prothrombin time in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants is recommended .  ( See < a href= \" flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interaction Studies . )  Phenytoin : DIFLUCAN increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin .  Careful monitoring of phenytoin concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and phenytoin is recommended .  ( See < a href= \" flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interaction Studies . )  Cyclosporine : DIFLUCAN may significantly increase cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients with or without renal impairment .  Careful monitoring of cyclosporine concentrations and serum creatinine is recommended in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and cyclosporine .

Depending on clinical circumstances , consideration should be given to increasing the dose of DIFLUCAN when it is administered with rifampin .  Theophylline : DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline .  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended .  Terfenadine : Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine , interaction studies have been performed .  One study at a 200 - mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval .  Another study at a 400 - mg and 800 - mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly .  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated .  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg / day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored .  Cisapride : There have been reports of cardiac events , including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered .  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval . The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated .  Astemizole : The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs .  In the absence of definitive information , caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole .  Patients should be carefully monitored .  Rifabutin : There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered .  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored .  Tacrolimus : There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered .  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored .  Short-acting Benzodiazepines : Following oral administration of midazolam , fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects .  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously .  If short-acting benzodiazepines , which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system , are concomitantly administered with fluconazole , consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage , and the patients should be appropriately monitored .  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol - and levonorgestrel - containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels ;  however , in some patients there were decreases up to 47 % and 33 % of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels .  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation .  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel , there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism .

When DIFLUCAN is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents , blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary .  Coumarin-type anticoagulants : Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants .  In post - marketing experience , as with other azole antifungals , bleeding events ( bruising , epistaxis , gastrointestinal bleeding , hematuria , and melena ) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole concurrently with warfarin .

Theophylline : DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline .  Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended .  Terfenadine : Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine , interaction studies have been performed .  One study at a 200 - mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval .  Another study at a 400 - mg and 800 - mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly .  The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated .  The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg / day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored .  Cisapride : There have been reports of cardiac events , including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered .  A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval . The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated .  Astemizole : The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs .  In the absence of definitive information , caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole .  Patients should be carefully monitored .  Rifabutin : There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered .  Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored .  Tacrolimus : There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered .  Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored .  Short-acting Benzodiazepines : Following oral administration of midazolam , fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects .  This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously .  If short-acting benzodiazepines , which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system , are concomitantly administered with fluconazole , consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage , and the patients should be appropriately monitored .  Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol - and levonorgestrel - containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels ;  however , in some patients there were decreases up to 47 % and 33 % of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels .  The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation .  While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel , there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism .

In this crossover steady state study , the pharmacokinetics of propafenone were unaffected in either phenotype by the coadministration of mexiletine .  Addition of mexiletine to propafenone did not lead to further electrocardiographic parameters changes of QRS , QTc , RR , and PR intervals than propafenone alone .

Mexitil    does not alter serum digoxin levels but magnesium-aluminum hydroxide , when used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms due to Mexitil   , has been reported to lower serum digoxin levels .  Concurrent use of Mexitil    and theophylline may lead to increased plasma theophylline levels .  One controlled study in eight normal subjects showed a 72 % mean increase ( range 35 - 136 % ) in plasma theophylline levels .  This increase was observed at the first test point which was the second day after starting Mexitil   . Theophylline plasma levels returned to pre - Mexitil    values within 48 hours after discontinuing Mexitil   . If Mexitil and theophylline are to be used concurrently , theophylline blood levels should be monitored , particularly when the Mexitil    dose is changed .  An appropriate adjustment in theophylline dose should be considered .  Additionally , in one controlled study in five normal subjects and seven patients , the clearance of caffeine was decreased 50 % following the administration of Mexitil   .", "doc_id": "af3812bf542f2962047369a028c22961"}

Conventional therapeutic drug monitoring based on measuring immunosupressive drug concentrations in blood is important in the clinical management of immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation medicine .

In addition , blood immunosuppressant levels are only indirect predictors of the pharmacologic effects on immune cells , because the genetic heterogeneity the immune systems of transplant recipients are not equally sensitive to drug effects .  Therefore , therapeutic drug monitoring requires the application of reliable and effective methods to study the pharmacodynamic variability by direct measurements of drug effects on immune cell functions .  Flow cytometry offers a multiplicity of quantitative analysis possibilities , from detection of phosphorylated molecules up to complex multicolor analysis of whole blood samples .  A large spectrum of flow cytometry - based applications for pharmacodynamic monitoring is available and allows detection and analysis of diverse function of T cells and dendritic cell subsets .  By combining several assays , it is possible to generate a broad picture of the immune status of every single transplanted recipient .
